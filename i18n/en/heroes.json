Speak up!\" The townsfolk have gotten used to the gruff male voice of Charlie.</p><p>The loud and rough Charlie has had a long career as an explosives demolitionist. A lot of people associate Charlie with his dangerous job and keep a distance from him.</p><p>However, just talk to Charlie and you will know this man has a heart of gold. Moreover, his constant yelling has nothing to do with an angry attitude. It's a side effect of years of explosives on Charlie's ear drums.</p><p>Charlie's explosives knowledge is invaluable for the difficult coal mining process. Despite his scruffy appearance, he is extremely attentive to detail. This helped him to stay safe in a risky line of work.</p><p>Charlie prefers to stay behind the battlefield wherever possible but is certainly not scared of a fight. Enemies will quickly discover the power of chemistry over swords. Not only is Charlie an expert on a wide variety of explosives and grenades, but his strong arms provide decent throw range. Charlie has not won the battlefield nickname \"the grenadier\" for nothing.</p><p>There are two guaranteed ways to provoke Charlie: the first is to violate safety procedures during the coal mining process. The second is to attempt to plunder fellow workers' hard-won resources. Crazy Joe and his bandits have learned that lesson the hard way. Nothing has ever sent Joe's bandits into a full retreat as quickly as Charlie's explosions.</p><p>Joe has not taken Charlie's explosive retaliation to heart. In fact, Joe has become quite interested in Charlie's potential as a fellow outlaw. He often dreams about what he could do with someone like Charlie in his group. Fortunately, Charlie does not know, nor does he care about Joe's interest in him.</p>",

She became particularly skilled at hunting, and it wasn’t long before she was bringing home game for her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she grew older, Cloris became more and more interested in survivalism. She started reading books about wilderness survival, learning about everything from building shelters to making fire without matches. She became obsessed with the idea of living off the land and being completely self-sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she turned 18, Cloris decided to strike out on her own. She packed up her gear, including her trusty bow and arrows, and set out into the forest. For the first few weeks, she struggled to find enough food and water to survive.

He's happy to accept demanding tasks and gets rather restless when he is not physically exhausted from work. Rumor has it that Eugene's strange temperament may have much to do with his equally strange past. Eugene approaches combat with the same zest, his large axe is a terror to any foes in his way.</p><p>A man like Eugene, who works hard and conducts himself well, is always welcomed in any City. He certainly does love his liquor - but only in his free time. Only the blacksmith has an issue with Eugene - his axes have to be replaced rather frequently.</p><p>Eugene is stubborn in his choice of tools and has zero interest in trying out more convenient alternatives like the new steam-powered chainsaws. Eugene's first choice would always be those crafted by his drinking buddy Smith, as his axes are the sturdiest and easiest to handle.</p><p>A major accident several years ago left Eugene with a strange vision: he began seeing \"evil spirits\" everywhere. The constant sense of anxiety eventually drove him over the edge. He fought the demonic vision, only to later discover he had attacked none other than the Chief of the City. He was cast out into the frozen tundra and was luckily saved by a passing caravan.</p><p>Dr. Philly surmised that Eugene's excessive exposure to an unstable fire crystal had altered his memory and senses. It had also made him incredibly strong and short-tempered. Although Philly could not find a cure, there was a temporary solution: exhausting manual labor prevented the visions.</p><p>Logging has since become his answer to the \"evil spirits\" problem until a more permanent cure can be found.

He has claimed to friends that he simply follows the \"will\" of the metal as he intuitively interprets it - that's his secret to making the best weapons.</p><p>Smith's forging talents did not come easily. In fact, he was abducted and forced to work as a blacksmith on the \"Neptune\" steam submarine as a child.</p><p>It was a dark time, made darker still by Smith's fear of the sea and confined spaces.

Gina’s motto is ingrained in every member of the group: \"Discipline is strength\".</p><p>Gina had a very negative experience early in her career. It was an inter-City war. After she helped the winning Chief secure victory, Gina saw the fallen City's survivors being put to the sword. Gina kept telling herself they were merely performing a contract, but the war crimes had caused much self-doubt. Since then, the group never raised their swords against innocent survivors.</p><p>Gina is a hard-nosed mercenary, but she also has a softer side.

Jasser has already travelled more in his single lifetime than most survivors of an entire city. And always his goal remains the same: to find a way to heal our troubled world.<br />\n<br />\nJasser has accumulated enough knowledge as a maverick scientist and explorer to make himself quite useful to both the Dawn Alliance and Phaethon, both of which have made overtures. Jasser's ideology may align more closely with the Dawn Alliance, but he is not one to make himself beholden to any cause and is happy enough to part with whatever he has learned so as to ensure the Chiefs of various cities have enough cause to welcome him with open arms. <br />\n<br />\nIf Jasser's survival on the ruthless Tundra can be ascribed to one factor, it must be courage under pressure.<br />\n<br />\nJasser's first foray onto the Tundra took place as a member of an expeditionary force struck down by an enormous snowstorm soon after leaving their Settlement. Survivors don't last long in snowstorms, and yet Jasser somehow managed to pathfind his way to an abandoned shelter without which the team would have certainly been found frozen the next morning. Yet their troubles had only just begun. The shelter was immediately attacked by a horde of ravenous animals, and with many fellow explorers wounded, Jasser had to fend off the beasts mostly alone with a gun and hunting knife. In all this Jasser never showed a hint of anxiety, so much so that teammates nicknamed the taciturn explorer \"Fortress Jasser\".<br />\n<br />\nJasser is well aware that his refusal to join a faction could make life difficult, and would probably align himself with the Dawn Alliance rather than Phaethon if forced.<br />\n<br />\nIn the Dawn Alliance's favor is its humanitarian concern for the fate of survivors in this post-Chill world, a sympathetic perspective Jasser feels is somewhat over-emphasized as wellbeing should not, in his view, be humanity's top priority. In this regard, Phaethon's iron commitment to restoring the old world comes much nearer Jasser's own goals. But he cannot ignore the atrocities committed at Phaethon's hands, sins which—among other things—have cost them Jasser's potential loyalty.<br />\n<br />\nJasser has been a voracious reader of all kinds of encyclopedias and arcane volumes since childhood, in which he benefited greatly from growing up in a town featuring probably the largest surviving library in the world at that time, and in which he spent many long evenings. Jasser's broad depth of knowledge has given him a unique appreciation for the way life in the old world used to be, for the stories and the songs mostly lost to time. The memory of earth's past exerts a special hold over Jasser's imagination. It is there that Jasser's never-ending quest for a scientific solution to the world's woes must be located: surely there is a way to end the march of ice. Surely.</p>",

Even before the Great Chill, her legion of elite soldiers were the terror of bandits everywhere. Unlike other border armies who bunkered behind city gates, Ling Xue's Iron Eagles preferred to go out and fight. And fight they did with devastating precision, always striking at the very heart of the enemy.<br />\nOne of Ling Xue's advantages is an uncanny mastery of terrain. This often allows her to splinter and crush much larger forces by moving, for example, against an enemy camp at night to sow confusion. Most commanders would not dare to enter into so much danger. Yet Ling Xue trusts full well in her ability to extricate her men from any situation as long as they have the advantage of surprise.<br />\n<br />\nAnd so Ling Xue became the terror of the borderlands, a fiery six-armed, three-headed hydra of outlaw folklore. The truth is that Ling Xue would not be recognized in a crowd easily without her armor. In fact, her rich and varied life outside the art of war includes a fondness for unconventional baking techniques—as awkward as that makes some grizzled veterans feel.<br />\n<br />\nLing Xue's practical childhood training with wasters was accompanied by plenty of theoretical book-study. But Ling Xue is not academic. Her skills lie more in the kind of adaptability scorned by other generals unaccustomed to spontaneous tactics. Ling Xue was never going to win any favors with the upper military establishment simply because of her ancestors. The only way to climb the ranks at the border is by proving oneself in battle. And she eagerly watched and looked forward to whenever that day would come.<br />\n<br />\nThere's a reason why crisis and opportunity go hand-in-hand. Ling Xue was no more than a centurion accompanying the emperor's nephew on a routine inspection as an unusually large bandit army decided to attack. Outnumbered 3-to-1, The emperor's nephew began panicking. Ling Xue looked him straight in the eye and declared the bandit leader had no idea how much trouble was in.<br />\nThe bandits quickly moved to flank Ling Xue's smaller bodyguard well outside the gates. It was a fatal mistake. Ling Xue's unit immediately charged. The bandit leader had his hands tied behind his back before most of them realized what was going on. The rest quickly turned and fled at the sight of their hostage leader.\nThe emperor's nephew returned home safe and sound.

Surrounded by lush green mountains, his homeland was a hidden paradise untouched by the frozen Tundra. For generations, his people lived in harmony with the land, until the frost began to creep in.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Phaethon arrived uninvited, the valley's vibrant life began to fade. The tribe knew that the \"heart\" of the land had been tainted, allowing the cold to take root. Determined to save the home he loved, Lumak set out on a journey to find a way to heal the land.<br />\n<br />\nLumak's father was a legendary warrior, and that legacy lives on in him. Even as a child, he had the strength and courage to face wild beasts head-on. By the time he came of age, he was already a match for his father. Armed only with traditional weapons, he was able to hold his own against Phaethon's forces and their far superior equipment. He fought side by side with his father, defending their sacred land from those who dared to defile it.<br />\n<br />\nAt the heart of Emerald Valley lies a spring—pure, sacred, and full of life. Its waters nourish every corner of the land with energy and spirit.Phaethon, driven by greed, sought to unravel its secrets. But their reckless experiments poisoned the spring beyond repair. To protect his people and the sacred spring, Lumak's father sacrificed his life. Taking up his father's spear, Lumak vowed to drive out the invaders. After years of struggle, he finally led his people to reclaim their homeland.<br />\n<br />\nLumak roamed the Tundra in search of a cure. He clashed with Phaethon time and again, but also forged lasting bonds with the heroes of the Dawn Alliance. With their help, the sacred spring was finally purified, and Emerald Valley began to flourish once more. Still, Lumak chose to remain on the front lines, to honor his newfound friendships, and to make sure Phaethon paid for what they had done.</p>",

At least our diners can reach heaven!\" - Patrick.\\n Masterchef Patrick of Sunfire Castle has always believed nice food helps to uplift the spirit. He has spent most of his life developing, researching, and cooking the best dishes in the world. He has earned recognition from the President and local nobles of all stripes.<br />\n<br />\nPatrick's life was turned upside down by the collapse of the Solaris Royal Family. Though he was no longer the Masterchef, life still has to go on. In the Cities, he no longer had access to the royal pantry and had to scramble for ingredients and condiments. Many still remark on his inventive cuisine as comparable to the finest in the old world.<br />\n<br />\nOccasionally, Patrick's skills are also needed in battle. Pantry thieves and resource hunt have made combat a necessity. To many\u2019s surprise, Patrick is a descent fighter. Not only does he possess a lifetime's worth of experience handling all kinds of knives, he also has the strength and stamina to use them quite efficiently. The busy kitchen has honed his intuition that can be easily applied to other \"dynamic\" situations.<br />\n<br />\nThis is not to say the renowned Masterchef Patrick never gets it wrong. Necessity is the mother of invention, and much inventiveness is needed in Cities. Anyone sampling his newest creations should be cautious - new ingredients can be tricky even for a seasoned chef like Patrick. Bahiti can particularly attest to this.<br />\n<br />\nPatrick has taken the loss of his position at Sunfire Castle fairly well, all things considered. The low point was when he and several other public servants were trapped in a makeshift shelter following the collapse of Sunfire Castle. After a while, the supply ran low and everyone thought they were doomed. <br />\n<br />\nPatrick went to great effort to ensure the group's \"last meal\" would at least be a happy one. But despair soon gave way to warmth as the delicious food soothed their earlier exhaustion. The group outlasted the snowstorm and arrived together at a new shelter - in no small part thanks to that meal, which was the most meaningful moment of Patrick's career.</p>",

Likewise, music and other higher forms of entertainment have always been a rare commodity in this new icy world.<br />\n<br />\nVirtually everyone can appreciate the efforts of Seo-yoon and her merry band of minstrels, as they are sometimes called, in travelling from settlement to settlement in echoes of touring musicians of the old world. Certainly, plenty of merriment, laughter, songs of joy and dance will be found in every community they visit.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon strikes most folk as a gentle soul on first impression, humble with a certain elegance of spirit. Only the most discerning or those who know Seo-yoon well will recognize the iron stubbornness and bravery behind her eyes. Fewer still would know of Seo-yoon's skills as a close quarters combatant with a proven track record of defending her companions in need, or the evil uses to which her drumsticks can be turned when the situation calls for it.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon's drumming skills are probably her most legendary. A smart Chief should not underestimate the inspirational effect of music on troops, even troops who seem to lack a single musical bone in their body.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no substitution for talent. Even if Seo-yoon has practiced her instruments for many years, what she possesses is nothing less than a special kind of musical magnetism, an ability to channel her heart and soul into a language all listeners can hear. Few drummers generate the responses that Seo-yoon excites after a few minutes.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon owes much of her fame to a privileged upbringing in one of the wealthiest Cities in the Tundra, a relative utopia compared to many others overrun by cold and wind. This afforded her the opportunity to study music and choreography to her heart's content, at which she had already showed exceptional promise as a young girl. Seo-yoon's ability to play nearly any instrument after a short practice session did not escape her father's proud notice.<br />\n<br />\nA strict survivalist, Seo-yoon's father was a stern but kindly man who considered it his duty to prepare his only daughter for every eventuality that may come to pass in the new world. Musical practice was always followed by rigorous combat training that, if all went well, would never be used. Fate had other plans.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon's wealthy Settlement was raided by a large group of bandits in her late teenage years. Caught by surprise, most of the city's defenders were quickly massacred, including her father, while others fled on foot from their homes into the icy wilderness. The situation seemed utterly hopeless, but something in Seo-yoon refused to yield. And in that stubbornness she found hope. She took to her instruments and began playing a rousing martial theme that she kept up through the night until early morning, although there was little sign of any significant response.<br />\n<br />\nIt was only when dawn came, and the beautiful golden sun lit up the edges of the horizon that the Settlement's survivors looked around at each other and realized they were still great in number. This might just be the occasion for a miracle. Seo-yoon called for volunteers and, one by one, brave warriors pledged themselves into a ragtag counter-attack force. The invaders, many drunk on the town's wine or napping from the heavy celebrations following their so-called victory, were unprepared. The rest is history.<br />\n<br />\nIn the end, Seo-yoon had played a critical role in winning back the resolve of her people and their home, to which she was given a hero's welcome. Seo-yoon was not just a musician now, but an inspiring warrior and commander.</p>",

The unflappable veteran's reputation for courage is also matched by his steely demeanor off the field. He and his military expertise are invaluable assets to the Dawn Alliance. Sergey and his band are often the only force standing between a City and the deadly threats of this frozen land.<br />\n<br />\nIt is public knowledge that Sergey was at one point, sentenced to death for \"unforgivable crimes\" as a senior captain in the Royal Solaris Guard. Exactly what crime could have merited death for the distinguished serviceman, and how he escaped the sentence, are much lesser known.<br />\n<br />\nSergey spent much of his youth in the Sunfire Military Academy located near the castle. There, he studied the best of military strategy, history, and tactics. He also learned the importance of rigid discipline, a standard that he has maintained with his own elite soldiers.<br />\n<br />\nAfter joining the Dawn Alliance, Sergey often serves as a City Constable. He certainly excels in the role of maintaining public order. However, outside of work, Sergey's strictness and lack of humor did not win him many personal friends.<br />\n<br />\nSergey's lack of personal engagement with the people around him may be a result of the scars of battle he received. Some scars are mental, others physical. This is particularly true of his last mission in the Royal Solaris Guard: to evacuate a City and save its people from enemy assault. Unfortunately, the pillagers came earlier than expected, and Sergey's forces were too small in comparison.<br />\n<br />\nThe royal guardsmen fought with everything they had and held on for three full days. Sergey's commanding officer saw the defense as a lost cause and ordered a tactical retreat to contain the military losses. Sergey was trained to follow the orders of a superior, but he knew retreating meant giving up on the lives of the civilians. Sergey was stuck.<br />\n<br />\nRacked with guilt over the fate of the survivors, Sergey ultimately decided to disobey a direct order for the first time in his life.He and his men organized the best possible defense the City could muster. They held out against all odds until the bandits retreated. The City was saved, and a grateful child handed him a bottle cap as the “medal” for his brave exploit. Little did the townsfolk know, the man that saved them would soon be standing before a military tribunal on the charge of insubordination.<br />\n<br />\nThe tribunal judged that discipline shall be upheld whatever the cost. Sergey the hero was to be executed by firing squad at dawn. It was the bottle cap “medal” in his breast pocket that miraculously saved his life.

  "hero.jeronimo.name": "Jeronimo",
  "hero.jeronimo.story": "Jeronimo was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was the heir of a local Duke in the old empire. Even after the old world's collapse, he maintained the noble style of dress, decorum, and speech. Many people dislike his demeanor, but none can deny that Jeronimo is an invaluable asset to the Dawn Alliance.\n\nHe is an extremely capable swordfighter. Jeronimo's techniques are the embodiment of sword-fighting science and art. Unfortunately, the intricacy of his techniques made it almost impossible for other soldiers to learn.\n\nJeronimo is also one of Dawn Alliance’s finest commanders, thanks to his education at the Imperial Military Academy. Jeronimo's early life in the upper class has raised him with expensive tastes. Such tastes are impossible to maintain even for an accomplished fighter like him. As a result, he accumulated a huge amount of debt. The debt drove him to work as a \"contract commander\" under Phaethon Mercenaries. He also became their duel master and trainer.\n\nHis years in the Phaethon had seen various engagements against the Dawn Alliance. Some members of the Alliance, Bahiti for one, can’t come to terms with that so easily. Jeronimo's upbringing and education made him a model of chivalry. He hated the underhanded techniques of Phaethon leaders, and his departure was an inevitability.\n\nPhaethon's revenge came quicker than Jeronimo's resignation. In a fight against bandits, Jeronimo was outmanned and Phaethon's promised reinforcements were nowhere to be seen. He sent an urgent request to the Dawn Alliance for help instead. From there, it was easy enough for the Alliance to persuade Jeronimo to join them.\n\nOff the battlefield, Jeronimo fancies himself as a poet, and most of his creations are love poetry. When they were on the same assignments, Cloris' fighting prowess and supposed royal bloodline stirred something in Jeronimo's heart. However, below is Cloris’ response to Jeronimo's many advances: \"Of all the awkward, stupid, and moronic things you do and say, Jeronimo, your love poems are surely the worst.\"",

She is a good companion for fellow survivors as well, although she tends to talk non-stop on topics of of her own interest.\n\nNatalia was little more than a baby when she met the grizzly cub Kasia. The cub was separated from its family, and wouldn’t have survived in the wilderness alone. Natalia and her father took Kasia in and raised it into a strong beast. The two were inseparable, and the cross-species bond is strong. After the passing of Natalia’s father, they depended on each other and survived together in the long winter...\n\nNatalia's father Tyle is a \"planetary ecologist\". By comparing soil samples throughout the years, Tyle concluded that the global cooling process might be slowing, and could even reverse at some point in the near future. This observation filled him with optimism. Tyle had also begun work on self-sustaining heat sources with experimental fire crystals. Even Phaethon took great interest in Tyle's work and began to sponsor his research...\n\nTyle's fire crystal technology was the greatest accomplishment of his scientific career. It had the potential to help all humankind, but can also cause disasters in the wrong hands. Tyle soon realized his sponsor was much more interested in personal gains than the greater good.

With the assistance of these guardians, the Solaris Dynasty came to possess control over the energy of the Fire Crystal.\n\nHowever, when the kingdom attained great power, the king betrayed his protectors and banished them. The Fire Crystal subsequently entered a dormant state, and the fate of the guardians remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nRecently, Ahmose's weapon alerted him to the reawakening of the Fire Crystal. As one of the last surviving descendants of the guardians, he left his clan behind and embarked on a mission of vengeance. After arriving at his destination, Ahmose was confronted with the reality that the former empire had collapsed. This left him in a dilemma as to whether he should support or oppose the new ruler of Sunfire Castle.\n\nAhmose’s spear and shield were once the sources of pride for his ancestors. The two weapons were infused with the energy of Fire Crystal and thus became alive. Once lost, the weapons were found when Ahmose heard their call. He restored them through forgery like he was rebuilding the former glory of his ancestors.\n\nAfter spending some time in the Sunfire Castle, Ahmose was certain that the new president was not a tyrant like the ruler of the old empire. By talking to the Cthugha’s Heart using his gift of resonating with it, he was sure that the president was the ruler acknowledged by many.\n\nCthugha’s Heart released Ahmose from his destiny as a guardian and gave him and his clansmen their freedom. Without the mission as a guardian, Ahmose suddenly lost his direction in life. Fortunately, his courage and outstanding combat skills won him the admiration of the chiefs.

  "hero.alonso.story": "The legends of Alonso \"the whale hunter\" was known far and wide.\nHe is described as a stout, well-built man of few words. He always carries his netting and trusty harpoon wherever he goes. This whale hunter travels from one seaside town to another in search of good ale and the intel on a certain sea monster.\n\nAccording to the stories, the monster that Alonso seeks is the same one that slaughtered his entire crew 30 years ago. He wishes to settle scores with the mythical \"Leviathan\" that took his crew, his friends, and his family...\n\nThe creature \"Leviathan\" grows more bizarre with each tavern retelling. Apparently, the beast has a huge horn and a body that spans hundreds of meters. Many laughed at such an impossible tale behind Alonso's back, but none dared to mock Alonso to his face. After all, this man is capable of taking down Giant Apes and Cryptids single-handedly.\n\nAlonso had defended many Cities from pillagers during his travel. In one instance, all the townsfolks panicked at the sight of bandits but Alonso rallied them and organized an excellent defense. When he gave orders, Alonso was like the captain of a City-sized ship.\n\nNot long ago, he caught a glimpse of a former crew member that was supposedly killed by \"Leviathan\" many years ago.\nAlonso refused to believe it had been a trick of the eyes. He questioned half the town and finally learned his former crew is now a slave onboard a giant, steam-powered submarine called the \"Neptune\". \"That’s it...\" Alonso thought to himself, \"Leviathan is not a monster, but a submarine!\". Now, he hopes to find Neptune and reunite with his former crew.\n\nTo Alonso, there is not much difference between hunting down a Leviathan and a lot of bandits.",

She is a master of firearms and not afraid to strike first.\nThere is only one reason to think otherwise: Blanchette takes care of a large group of orphaned children taken in by her late father, the orphanage's founder. Only in their presence will her cold exterior give way to warmth and laughter.\n\nBlanchette did not feel she was much more than a child herself when she became the leader of the orphanage, and has always tried to provide a safe space for her younger \"brothers and sisters\" since—with toys, treats, or even funny costumes, decorations, and plays.\nOne moment Blanchette may find herself acting out the role of \"Red Riding Hood\" or the \"Big Bad Wolf\" on a makeshift stage. But the terror will be far more real for anyone who might threaten her orphanage than ever experienced by any of those characters. Indeed, with the passing of time, there are moments Blanchette finds it hard to separate herself from the roles she plays on stage and the warrior she has to be out on the Tundra.\n\nBlanchette's father founded the orphanage in a fort purchased after a long career as an explorer. It is from him Blanchette inherited not only clarity of judgement but also excellent combat instincts.\nHer father's dreams of creating a safe space for abandoned children was quickly dashed after his passing, when her father's successor filled his pockets with the orphanage's riches before fleeing into the night. All alone, the children turned to young Blanchette. She would have to grow up very quickly.\nTheir first big test came soon after. A dangerous group of bandits had heard a false rumor the castle was filled with riches and broke in with knives and guns. Blanchette escorted the children to a safe space and then began picking off the intruders one-by-one.\nIt was a kind of baptism of fire into adulthood. When Blanchette finally opened the door to where the children had been hiding, she was nearly covered head to foot in bandit blood.\n\nCrisis averted, finding money to buy food became the orphanage's main worry. The older kids had to start work immediately in the nearby city with Blanchette taking on more lucrative, but highly dangerous bounty hunter contracts.\nSo great were Blanchette's worries then she could hardly sleep at night, and yet always put on a brave face for the children. The orphanage did not find itself on stable ground until the Dawn Alliance arrived with funding in exchange for Blanchette's assistance. Now she had the confidence to step out onto the field as one of the Dawn Alliance's newest and most dangerous assets.",

Despite what may have happened afterward, he is also one of the Eagles' finest warriors and will not tolerate anybody saying otherwise.\n\nA loyal soldier, Bradley earned his stripes primarily working artillery with his understanding of siege techniques, in this day and age, useful beyond measure. A calculating mind and occasional flashes of brilliance is the mainrason Bradley has retained his position as a member of Gina's mercenary company and, at one point, Captain Fawkner's rigth-hand man.\n\nThe only shadow over Bradley remains the unexplained disappearance of his entire battalion on expedition, in which he was the sole survivor somehow unable to recall the circumstances surrounding their loss. Bradley returned a changed man, withdrawn, unable to explain why large parts of his recollection were now missing. It is doubtful he would have remained in the company without the backing of thei new leader, Gina, by whose trust Bradley has mounted a slow but gradual recovey.\n\nBradley's skills in the mechanical operation of all types of cannons is complemented by excellent sharp-shooting skills, swordsmanship when the situation requires, as well as fairly decent close-quarters combat abilities. A respected strategist, Bradley has developed a reputation for surgical strikes and minimizing civilian casualties, often quoting that, \"Cannons do not win battles. Careful planning, timing, and hte courage to seize the moment do.\"\n\nBradley was born into a relatively well-known military family in the old Solaris Empire, resulting in his acceptance to the 'last class\" of the rapidity-dissolving Solaris Empire's prestigious Royal Academy. Truth be told, the Imperial facade was already beginning to cruumble before Bradley was handed his first uniform.\n\nBradley's regiment came increassing to represent what the collapse of the old Empire might mean for everyday survival in the freezing world. Bradley still held out hope their ragtag group could somehow help rebuild the Solaris Empire and its honorable traditions. Most accepted the new reality: discipline and honor were dead, and survival required a cruel hand. The latter sparked Bradley's transition to the mercenary life and confirmed his worst fears. The solaris Empire was gone and it would be rebuilt.\n\nOther than Captain Fawkner, just disappear? It was a relatively unexplored valley and site of many strange sightings. But why did only Bradley survive? Why can no one account for it?\n\nBradley could have been cast out on suspicion of treachery were is not for Commander Gina's abiding trust in the cursed man. Bradley has since begun a kind of regular pilgrimage to the same valley, seeking again and again some trace of Fawkner, his lost friends, or anything that might jog his memories.

Not even Mia, renowned for her mastery of illusions, can match his remarkable skill and boundless imagination. So impressed was she by his extraordinary talent that she invited him to join her caravan on its journey across the land.\nFrom teleportation and telekinesis to levitating the caravan, conjuring elegant ladies from paintings, or transforming audience into portraits—his inventive performances never fail to bring the house down. Thanks to him, the caravan rakes in a fortune. Yet, the applause of the crowd seems to leave him indifferent, as his sole passion lies in crafting even more breathtaking magic.\n\nBeyond the elaborate setups for his illusions, Dominic also excels at designing a range of concealable weapons, such as umbrellas that fire tranquilizer darts and boxes that unleash powerful punches. These ingenious tools help the caravan to turn the tables in the face of unexpected ambushes.\nPhysically strong and fearless, Dominic never fails to slip away from danger, using his masterful escape techniques to defy the odds.\nOn top of all his talents, Dominic is a master of disguise, able to gather vital intelligence for Mia with impeccable personas. What baffles her, however, is that while he effortlessly mingles with people in disguise, once he reverts to his true self, he becomes cold and utterly unapproachable.\n\nIn contrast to many members of the caravan, who have complex backgrounds or are on the run from enemies, Dominic is just an average man, making him an anomaly.\nDominic was once a wanderer with no place to call home, but that was due to his eccentric personality putting him at odds with the powerful. Joining the caravan has granted him true freedom, allowing him to focus entirely on perfecting his magic without needing to interact much with his quirky companions. With Mia's wealth, even his wildest ideas can be brought to life.\n\nDominic's father was once the most prominent magician in town, until the arrival of an engineer who ruined everything by seeing through even the most intricately designed tricks before they were completed. As the magic shows quickly lost their appeal, Dominic's father, disheartened, left home in search of greater skill.\nIn the beginning, Dominic's passion for magic was fueled by a desire to create the perfect illusion his father had always dreamed of, believing it would make his father stay if he ever returned. As he grew, he eventually crafted the ultimate trick that fooled everyone, including the engineer, but he never saw his father again. Still, the genius was not disappointed; he realized that magic was the only thing that truly mattered to him.",

And yet this odd pair have done far more for local residents than most, and earned whatever supplies they require many time over.\nEdith cannot remember a time when the metal humanoid affectionately named \"Mr. Tin\" wasn't a part of her life. His origins are a mystery -- as much a mystery as her own origins at least. But such mysteries pale in significance to the very real help by which Mr. Tin has made himself indispensable in every settlement and a favorite of children everywhere.\n\nMr. Tin did not always have a name nor a home, unless it were considered the enless Tundra. And so it would have a remained until his parts had rusted or the end of the world but for encountering a strange cradle heated by intriguing mechanic. A baby slept within.\nWhy did Mr. Tin shield the cradle in its arms until its deliverance to a nearby city? Instinct? Her cries certainly made impression on the terrified resident shrinking back from the metallic monstrosity. But actions speak louder than words. The cityfolk decided to welcome the duo with open arms. It is from this day forward that Mr Tiun earned this name.\n\nMr.Tin had won a permanent home amongst humans although nothing is free in an eternal winter.

She was a quick study, and soon became relied upon by Mr. Tin exclusively for repairs in wich she was more skilled than any other city craftspeople.\nEdith graduated into the role of Mr. Tin's spokesperson, substituting body language and his simple vocalizations for a language by wich the pair seemed to easily communicate. It was easy enough as, instead of parting ways as the years wore on, Edith and Mr. Tin were increasingly drawn into shared endeavors and each other's company.\n\nMr. Tin's source of power was not exactly a secret although in these times only the most well-educated could guess at the mysterious Fire Crsytal that lay humming beneath his shiny exterior. Yet how the Fire Crystal had been installed and the colossus created remained unanswered. In fact, the entity had begun as a prized masterpiece of a power-hungry maniac intent on a source of authority not reliant upon human subjects. A humanoid form and Fire Crystal were chosen, the which also imbued it with a primitive form of thinking, reasoning, and even what one migth call a kind of living vitality. The mechanical beast was trained with ruthless efficiency against mock targets yet failed to translate its destructive skills against enemies of flesh and blood. Nor did any amount of threating or shouting by the angry maniac make any difference.\nThe maniac's pet project, despite its early success, had failed.

  "hero.eleonora.story": "The frozen queen, the nation liberator, the Sunfire Castle mayor, the ruler of the tundra, the hope of Solaris, and the shield princess... All these describe Eleonora III, the current ruler of the Solaris Dynasty, whose legitimacy is recognized by few.\nAfter the fall of the her kingdom, Eleonora lived in exile under the protection of her loyal knights until she came of age. Now, she has blossomed into a formidable knight and an exceptional commander. While restoring her kingdom is her ultimate goal, she has to work as a mercenary to make a living.\n\nEleonora was just an infant when Sunfire Castle collapsed, leaving her with no memory of the old kingdom. For a long time, she simply accepted the mission to restore it, without truly resonating with the aspiration. However, during her years of exile, she endured much contempt and humiliation from the emerging nobility, and it was through this hardship that the desire to create her own kingdom began to take root in her heart.\n\nEleonora mastered the art of combat under the tutelage of Sir Gregory, even surpassing her mentor. She slowly built a reputation on the tundra with her remarkable skills.\nNevertheless, she didn't win everyone's approval. In Jeronimo's eyes, Eleonora and her followers were nothing more than some imposters pretending to be royalty, and he boldly claimed to have found the true princess. To clear her name, Eleonora decided to challenge the arrogant swordsman. Although Sir Gregory eventually intervened and stopped the duel, the desire to prove herself against Jeronimo still burned deep within her.\n\nWith the backing of some old nobles, Eleonora once captured a sprawling city to serve as her new capital. Yet, it wasn't long before she fell out with her benefactors.\nThe indulgent and corrupt nobles levied heavy taxes and forced labor upon the people, plunging them into misery. Eleonora, having once experienced the pain of being uprooted, saw through the cruelty of the old order. She tried to help the struggling masses, but her actions threatened the nobles' interests. In response, they turned their backs on her, expelled her from the new capital, and accused her of being an imposter.\n\nWith no other option but to start anew, Eleonora had the support of Sir Gregory and other loyal warriors. Now, she has wholeheartedly embraced the dream of restoring her kingdom—one founded on equality and compassion.",

  "hero.flint.story": "Flint is the flame that is always ready to burn down Phaethon in his vengeance. It’s almost certain that his personal crusade against Phaethon will only end in either his or Phaethon's demise.\n\nFlint and his ragtag followers (most of whom have suffered at the hands of Phaethon) often partnered with the Dawn Alliance in their fight against Phaethon's forces. Bahiti and the others knew that Flint would never take an innocent life. As for criminals and wrongdoers? They won’t receive any mercy from Flint's hands.\n\nFlint was a high-ranking military officer. In a scouting mission, he got separated from his own platoon and ended up in a remote City known as “Arcadia”. That City was the closest thing to utopia - a place filled with theaters, auditoriums, and even libraries! The City did not have weapons; its citizens were peace-loving scholars, so they do not see a need for firearms.\n\nFlint fell in love with the City and the machinist Jessie. His time in Arcadia made him believe a bright future can be built even in this icy world. His hope and belief were soon destroyed in a horrible raid on Arcadia.\n\nAn emissary from Phaethon showed up at Arcadia’s door and demanded the immediate transfer of all knowledge pertaining to \"fire crystal\". The Chief refused, knowing full well their research can be turned into destructive weapons of war. When Phaethon razed the City to the ground, Flint was the only fighter that put up a resistance. He was terribly injured during the fight but somehow survived the ordeal. His hopes for a better future are now replaced by a burning desire for vengeance.\n\nFlint and Jessie crossed paths again many years later. Embers of the couple's old affection still remained, but Jessie could not approve of Flint's all-consuming quest for vengeance. Flint will always hold a special place in Jessie's heart, but she can never bring herself to love a man dedicated to destruction. The former lovers have now drifted apart.",

  "hero.flora.name": "Flora",
  "hero.flora.story": "Flora is not an inherently unfriendly person, nor is she arrogant. Her aloofness comes from a deep-seated preference for interacting with nature and plants rather than the rough-and-tumble world of complex social interactions. Flora would much rather deal with the former and she does, sometimes for days at a time, in a special greenhouse expertly constructed by Zinman and Jessie.\nFlora does enjoy the company of others — she’s just particular about whose company she keeps. Lydia, fellow botanist and agricultural expert, is a great source of joy. Jessie too, whose ingenuity designed the greenhouse temperature regulator. With these like-minded souls of deep thoughts Flora can enjoy many hours of spirited conversation.\n\nHorticulture is great expertise in these icy times. It was not so many years ago that a Dawn Alliance patrol stumbled on a seed preservation facility left by scientists unknown. Flora was given the task of categorizing and, if possible, reusing the revitalized seeds to grow cold-resistant crops to meet food shortages. Many survivors today owe their soft warm bread and fresh fruit to Flora's pioneering work in the cultivation of new seed varieties.\n\nFlora's love of plants began with books her parents read to her at bedtime, books filled with pictures of the old world and its lush paradise. Could there really have been such lush jungles as shown in the faded yellow pages? Such verdant gardens? The thought tantalized and fascinated Flora.\nFlora couldn't stop imagining the fantastic potential within plants. What new and magical varieties could be grown by careful cultivation? She would make it her life's work. Alongside classic food crops, Flora has also taken an interest in the darker and more sinister varieties: poisonous, flesh-eating flowers and highly aggressive climbing vines. Luckily, the terrors of these dangerous pests have been kept mostly in check... mostly.\n\nIn these later years Flora has been deeply involved in the study of the great City of Arcadia, which first enchanted her when she was a child with stories of its magnificence and eyewitness accounts. Among them is Agnes, a living eyewitness scholar, who, together with other diehard souls, has been trying to gather a team to restore their lost home's former glory.\nAgnes' dreams of a New Arcadia shine to Flora like a beacon of hope. New Arcadia has big shoes to fill, but Flora is excited to be rebuilding paradise with the other survivors on fertile volcanic soil.

  "hero.fred.story": "\"Show me the fire. I'll deal with the heat!\"\n\nFred has been a dependable fixture of the City's fire brigade for what seems like centuries, first to wade into the fiery maelstrom, last to surrender survivors' dwellings to the flames. Many years of service have built up a strong sense of gratitude on behalf of grateful survivors for his efforts.\n\nA Fire Chief has to be smart too. Fred hasn't survived this long without building up an uncanny understanding of unusual scenarios and a sixth sense for risk. This is surely why the last great engineers of the Solaris Dynasty gifted Fred with the so-called \"Antifire\", an extremely advanced and powerful piece of firefighting equipment the likes of which has never been seen since.\n\nStrip away all the oldworld heroics and Fred consistently models a strong sense of humility and kindness, endearing him to his fervent fans everywhere—particularly in the Dawn Alliance. If Fred has a fault, an extremely minor one, it is that the man simply doesn't have much of a sense of humor (or, for that matter, the ability to detect sarcasm). To quote Bahiti on this topic: \"Fred's the nearest I've ever seen to a perfect human being. If only he could lighten up a little...\"\n\nFred would not claim to be perfect. Many decades ago, when the world was a very different place, Fred was already well-known in the Solaris Capital as the city's youngest ever and most successful fire chief. It was in fact on the eve of a ceremony celebrating Fred's achievements, with the anointing of a great bronze figurine in his honor at the Fire Bureau's gates, when disaster struck! The great Fire Crystal at the heart of the capital, powering much of its industry, ignited into an enormous explosion that rocked the city. Fred's failures that night have become an eternal weight on his conscience.\n\nFred has had plenty of time to ponder the collapse of the Empire in the years following. Had he been but a noble cog in its unfeeling machine, blinded by devotion? Which, once the pomp and majesty were removed, was covered by the scars of suffering and injustice? Fred has learned to accept that for all the faults of the new world, cities today do not have to maintain themselves at such a vast human cost.\n\nIt was the arrival of the Dawn Alliance that ultimately filled Fred's heart with the hope missing since the Great Collapse. Now he is devoted not only to the extinguishing of harmful fires, but to that much deadlier fire: the fire of war, which threatens all of humanity.",

  "hero.freya.name": "Freya",
  "hero.freya.story": "Freya once thought the Tundra was the worst thing that could happen to the world. The Blood Moon Plague proved her wrong.\nThe name of Freya's hometown has been lost to the history books. It is now known as Hell, the Land of No Return, or the Abandoned City. Its once vibrant streets are covered in fog. None approach. But if a lost traveler were to venture near, they might still hear something: screams and shouts to chill them to their bones.\nAs a Nightguard, Freya and her fellow sentries were well-protected at the city outskirts inside a tower with plenty of food when the Blood Moon came. Never would they have guessed that one day they would not be defending against invaders, but preventing former family and friends from ever getting out.\n\nBut someone always slips through.\nWords cannot describe the terror on a traveling merchant who, after wandering off a mountain path, came face to face with the monsters of Hell. Crooked, misshapen human things covered in grotesque scarlet crystal flower petals, their jet black eyes full of darkness and suffering.\nThe next thing the merchant knew, the monsters had fallen to the ground with a glint of cold steel and he was being dragged back to a sentry tower by a shadowy figure. This lady—his unfriendly savior—said nothing as she called for a doctor to give a full examination.\nA strange figure in a bird mask examined the merchant carefully for a disease referred in hushed tones as the \"Blood Moon Plague\". Fortunately, he was allowed to go free with a strict warning and ominous feeling that if he had shown any signs whatsoever of the plague—whatever that was—he would have been treated very differently.\n\nPhilly, investigator of all strange diseases, originally named it the Blood Moon Plague upon hearing Freya's harrowing account.\nThe first rule of plague is to prevent its spread, which Philly urged the sentries to do. He struggled to come to terms with the mysterious illness that seemed to spread via crystals and fog, turning men into beasts with great speed.\nFreya was the exception who, once she recognized in her body the signs of infection, merely collapsed. So she was kept under observation. Eventually, as if by some miracle, she began to observe her own recovery. Her body's natural defenses began to survive, even thrive. Now she is the only one who can walk through Hell with impunity. Great strength has also come through the inactivated remnants of the disease in her body.\nFreya has since become a key member of her fellow Night's Guard survivors: a lady immune, with super strength, tasked with keeping the gates of Hell firmly closed.\n\nHades was once called Metiya, a tiny city on the edge of the wilderness.\nLife in the age of ice and cold was a tough adjustment. The City's Furnace was often short of materials. It was in these desperate times a strange visitor arrived with a promise of abundance if he could run a little \"experiment\". It was a success at first. People gained great strength and energy even without food. They could walk outside without feeling the cold. But grotesque deformities soon followed, rage, and a terrible madness.\nIn the end, the vast majority of \"subjects\" lost all reason and began attacking their neighbors. A fog descended at roughly the same time over the whole town, either a cause or consequence of the plague—Freya cannot say. She was then infected. As her eyes turned cold and red and dim she looked upward. The full moon should have been silver-gray. It was completely covered in blood.\nThat is all Freya remembers of her long recovery. Now there is only the hope that just as she has healed, Hell's residents can do some too.",

  "hero.gatot.name": "Gatot",
  "hero.gatot.story": "Gatot is a valiant warrior as well as an outstanding commander. He came from a faraway land with an elite squad, seemingly in search of something on the tundra.\n\nLittle is known about Gatot's past. Uncertain about his stance, many chiefs on the tundra keep their distances from him. For some reason, Gatot and his followers exhibit strong hostility toward the Phaethon. Following the principle, \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\" the Dawn Alliance has high hopes for Gatot. Gatot might not be interested in joining the alliance, but he is impressed by the valor displayed by its warriors in their battles against the Phaethon.\n\nThe first cooperation between the Dawn Alliance and Gatot took place when the former was facing a perilous situation.\n\nAt that time, the Phaethon launched an attack on the camp resided by the alliance's top guns, having intercepted crucial intelligence. The camp was in dire straits under Helios Cannon's relentless Firepower and Zenobia's swift charge.\n\nAt that critical moment, Gatot joined the battle as a third party. The unexpected presence of his squad on the flanks tore apart the Phaethon's formation.\n\nDuring a one-on-one battle, Gatot successfully stabbed the arrogant Zenobia, providing an opportunity for Logan to break free. All by himself, Logan reached the peak of a cliff and destroyed the cannon. In the end, the two formidable forces worked in tandem to repel the Phaethon's attack. Despite turning down the chance to join the Dawn Alliance, Gatot made no secret of his admiration for Logan and his wish to recruit him as a general of his squad.\n\nGatot is actually a king of a faraway, exotic land. As a teenager, he ascended to the throne when his kingdom was plagued by both internal conflicts and external threats. In just a few years, he stabilized his precarious rule and quelled rebellions, restoring unity in his discordant kingdom. His people saw him as a hero after he fended off formidable enemies against overwhelming odds.\n\nThrough his persistent efforts in territorial expansion, his kingdom had prospered like never before. In just ten years on the throne, he already emerged as the greatest king of the kingdom.\n\nHowever, the good times did not last long. Because of an incident, Gatot was forced to entrust his kingdom to another to embark on a journey away from his homeland...\n\nA priceless treasure was once hidden in Gatot's palace—a peculiar book that recorded the fate of the world but remained undecipherable.\n\nA few years back, a Phaethon's emissary visited his palace. Considering the emissary was knowledgeable and well-versed in ancient languages, Gatot invited her to unravel the secrets within the book. However, the mystery remained unsolved, and the book was gone along with the mysterious emissary.\n\nGatot attributed the loss of the book to his negligence. As the king, he felt compelled to shoulder the responsibility of retrieving the national treasure. Before setting off on his expedition together with his most trusted legion, he swore in front of his people to never return until the book was reclaimed from the Phaethon.",

  "hero.gisela.name": "Gisela",
  "hero.gisela.story": "The petite girl from Oestermore does not look like one of its foremost mechanical geniuses—youngest ever to be honored with the Craftsmaster title. Yet largely by the work of her hand has Oestermore been furnished with an array of newfangled weaponry: the so-called auto-turret, mech-guard, and pilotless flyer craft.\nFine as these inventions are, the finest yet may be Gisela's personal mini-shield—designed to do for the individual what great shields do for cities: protect Oestermorians from sword and musket fire. Trials are ongoing. The device is \"not entirely stable\".\n\nAll this is so much more impressive considering Gisela's small size and \"fountain of youth\" effect projected by her wrinkle-face. Gisela would much rather be taken seriously than dismissed for not looking like a typical gray-haired Craftmaster from Oestermore. The fastest way to offend Gisela is to talk down to her. And she is often offended.\nNecessity is the mother of invention and Gisela's need for more respect has led to the mech-arm. Want a few tons moved at short notice? Steel punched into shape? Overcome your fears and ask the scary-looking lady with the big shiny arms. Gisela is not a particularly violent person, far from it. Those who get to know her will recognize a truly gentle soul.\n\nTruthfully, there are plenty of reasons for Gisela to be happy about being underestimated: to be underestimated by an enemy is an incredible gift.\nBefore Gisela rose to Craftsmaster came the Bad Times. Phaethon's armies came like an avalanche. Oestermore's craftsmen, scientists, and engineers were placed into captivity. At the time, Gisela was glad not to be taken seriously by Phaethon's soldiers, was left to her own devices. With much of the city under lock and key, Phaethon had chosen not to dispose of the weapons piled near the city gates. Gisela immediately set to work under cover of night, building an army of turrets, distractions, and surprises to trigger at the right moment. Then with the Horn of Oestermore at her lips, Gisela struck, overwhelming camp guards and immediately arming the captives.\nPhaethon came prepared for a pitched battle, not guerrilla warfare in strange streets. Phaethon's force quickly collapsed and was driven out, leaving their precious equipment behind.\n\nToday Oestermore is a peaceful place, haunted not by Phaethon but whatever technical wizardry the crafters of tomorrow are cooking up—like the legend of \"Jumping Jack\" who has recently been terrifying and fascinating the City by leapfrogging towers in a single bound. Gisela's refusal to join in the investigation has also set tongues wagging.\nShe has her reasons. Fellow inventor Lloyd worked for years on a mechanical exo-suit to help his ailing father before finally turning to Gisela for help. The duo stitched the engineering marvel together with remarkably few issues. The largest was discovered by Lloyd as guinea pig: the exo-suit failed to respond to user inputs once it really got going, that is, jumping.\nLloyd miraculously survived uninjured once the suit lost power. News of the flying hunk of junk spread fast, sending Oestermore's rumor mill into overdrive. Gisela and Lloyd are very happy their secret is not yet out.",

  "hero.gordon.name": "Gordon",
  "hero.gordon.story": "Gordon is a terrifying presence despite his scholarly demeanor, particularly for those he deems not to have the best interest of the Tundra's civilians and its cities at heart. Plunderers and pillagers, in other words, have much to fear from Gordon's reputation as the 'great poisoner of our time\".\nThe strongest shield and the toughest armor will do nothing against Gordon's weapon of choice: the slow toxin for the man he wishes to immobilize or elixir of pain for the man he wishes to torture without leaving a mark. Nor does the poison-resistant Gordon have anything to fear from his own devices. As Bahiti has noted with joy: \"We should thank our lucky stars Gordon only deploys his unusual talents on those seeking to do harm.\"\n\nBy day Gordon does nothing more adventurous than teaching, by wich he shares his extraordinary scientific knowledge with the most brilliant minds of the next generations. His students have little to fear from the erudite professor who has killed thousands, because his reputation is improved by his teachning ability and charisma.\nIt is only outside the city, against those threatening the lives of innocent, that Gordon exercices his peculiar poisons without mercy against the \"locusts\" as he describes them. And in so doing he becomes a madman, willing to deploy fast-acting poisons and deadly mists across every corner of the battlefield to asphyxiate those who do not \"deserve\" to live.\n\nGordon's strange mix of elegance and rage can be traced back to his horrific experience as mayor of a wealthy city turned hellish wasteland through the efforts of Phateon and Dr. Toxin Theodore. To Dr. Toxin, Phaethon represented the hole to his key of continued scientific experimentation, ideological difference notwithstanding. Dr. Toxin ordered a full-scale chemical bombardment. He had finally found his \"experimental subjects.\" As mayor, Gordon was selected for special treatment-he was submerged in a cellar filled with a toxic goo of unknown effect. There he was left to rot for seven days and nigths by cruel observers eager to understand more. It was seven days of pure torture.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\". This was certainly true in Gordon's case.\nSeven days later Gordon's experimenters had an answer: the chemical goo was painful,yes, but produced no long-lasting physical deformities. And when the Dawn Alliance finally wrested control of the ruins from Dr. Toxin's hands, Gordon was surprised to discover he was hardly injured and, unlike most other residents, remained of sound mind. Furthermore, his lengthy immersion seemed to have made him immune to many other common toxins as well.\nGordon's life mission is now to inflict such horros on Dr. Toxin Theodore as to horrify the world, yet his thirst for revenge has not twisted his mind beyond reason. He knows the past cannot be fixed, but feelsa moral duty to prevent similar tragedies from occuring. Thus, Gordon has become a great crusader against the evil locusts and to \"return their poison for poison\".",

  "hero.greg.name": "Greg",
  "hero.greg.story": "From Greg’s perspective, the frozen world is like a forest full of perils. Only the harshest environment can dehumanize one and bring out one’s evil side the best. “That’s why we need order,” he said.\n\nGreg tries to restore the order of the world with rationality and regulations, and he is devoted to maintaining the dignity of the law. As a judge, he is impartial and dedicated to his job, but he is often sabotaged by others because of that. More than once his life has been put on the line, but he never wavers. On the contrary, he became more determined than ever after going through many life-and-death situations.\n\nThis is his warning for the lawless: One day, you will all be sanctioned by the Edict. Although the Solaris has fallen, Grey still defends the old law as usual.\n\nHe understands that some of the old regulations are outdated, considering that the Edict protects the rights of the long-gone aristocrats. Nevertheless, there are no better options at the moment. Perhaps, Greg will accept the suggestion of the Dawn Alliance one day and help them put together a new Edict.\n\nGreg's ideology is very different from the vigilante Flint. Greg believes the desire for vengeance is no reason to bypass trials and proper judicial proceedings. Flint, on the other hand, would rather just burn Phaethon and all the despicable marauders to the ground. Although Flint is on Greg’s list of wanted suspects, Greg has never laid a hand on Flint even when coming face-to-face with him.\n\nSergey's story is the only thing that made Greg question his own commitment to strict jurisprudence. Did Sergey really deserve a death sentence for disobeying his superiors in an attempt to protect a City? Greg admitted, \"If I was the judge that day, I do not know whether I should pass the sentence.\"",

  "hero.gregory.name": "Gregory",
  "hero.gregory.story": "\"For the glory of the empire! For old Solaris!\" Gregory's impassioned battle cry has never wavered even if today the Solaris Empire is but a distant memory.\nThe Empire's reign ended the day Sunfire Castle fell to an army of bandits. The tundra had spoken. Everybody was on their own, including Gregory's soldiers, who, like many other Solaris ex-military, were forced into the mercenary life to make ends meet. Yet, in his heart of hearts, Gregory has never stopped pining for a return to the Empire's glory days where the Solaris banner can once again fly high atop Sunfire Castle.\nThe men under Gregory are less optimistic, but certainly don't mind the bread and creature comforts that come with Gregory's competent leadership. He remains a popular commander, then as now.\n\nAs a swordsman on horseback Gregory is perhaps unequalled; as a tactician and oldworld infantry specialist willing to strike hard and fast he may be the best. It was no accident Gregory found himself at the head of the old empire's last Dawnguard squad, and it is largely thanks to their sacrificial, loyal efforts that the young Empress was saved.\nTheir escape from Sunfire Castle brought its own complexities: what was the role of the Empress in this new world? And, more importantly, how would they cope without a household retinue of servants, squires, and maids?\n\nContrary to Gregory's appearance, he is not a rough man by any means. Those who know him well will testify of a soft underside to his stern face and tenderness particularly toward the young empress.\nAs a matter of principle, Gregory still considers the empress to hold a kind of royal authority—to whom he will often act as an uncle, advisor, butler or bodyguard when danger calls. Gregory is also keen to preserve the old ways of the Solaris Empire by insisting, for example, on courtly decorum and regal outfits for Her Majesty and entourage no matter how impossible the Empire's restoration may seem.\n\nThe day Sunfire Castle fell is forever burned into Gregory's memory: the day he lost everything but a newfound purpose.\nGregory received his orders from the dying Captain of the Guard: the young empress was still alive! But to reach safety his men would have to thread a needle of life through absolute chaos, confusion, looting, and bloodshed. It was an almost impossible task and yet at the end Gregory led the empress safety out of the city with blood pouring from several arrow wounds in his armor. As his men planned to take the empress somewhere safe he then, as he gazed upon her terrified eyes, found the strength from within to pick himself up and press on. Thereafter his fate would be bound to that of the heir-apparent, and he would be her most loyal protector.",

  "hero.gwen.name": "Gwen",
  "hero.gwen.story": "Gwen and Norah often elicit diverse first impressions although both may be equally respected commanders of the Dawn Alliance.\n\nThe commander of a mechanized brigade, Norah excels at lightning-fast charges, disrupting enemy formations, ambushes, and daring raids. By contrast, Gwen exudes a scholarly, bookish aura. Her high standing in the Dawn Alliance has come only from her revolutionary flying machines which can mark enemy movements from high above the battlefield. An exceptional pilot, Gwen has pioneered a myriad of intricate inventions instrumental to many difficult Dawn Alliance missions.\n\nAs the machinist Jessie once said of Gwen: \"An engineering prodigy, one of only a few in the world, Gwen's trinkets have done the Alliance enormous good. But I think what Gwen really wants is to create aircraft that will conquer the skies.\"\n\nGwen is not fond of combat, but her father's tragedy has also left her with the realization that sometimes fighting and its brutal consequences cannot be avoided. Gwen is a remarkably strong fighter thanks to her older sister Norah's guidance and training. Gwen's prudence still shines through as she tends to disengage when the outcome is uncertain. Ironically, Gwen finds herself most at risk when testing out new machine prototypes. Invention can often be a risky endeavor.\n\nThe love Norah holds for her younger sister Gwen is undeniable, yet their journey together has not been without its fair share of conflict. Despite Norah's many attempts to make Gwen wise to the ways of battle, she still harbors profound fears for Gwen's safety in a real firefight. Norah does not want to go through the loss of another family member. Similarly, Norah is anxious about her sister's obsession with flying machines. She worries for Gwen's safety during the invention process and that all these trinket may well prove fruitless. There is also Norah's perspective on Gwen's scientific efforts, highly reminiscent of their father. Just like their father's tragic tale, Norah believes that all the knowledge in the world is futile when faced with the threat of violence and need for self-preservation.\n\nNorah and Gwen's sisterly relationship has improved. For example, Norah has recently embraced Gwen's active involvement in combat and focus on research. A considerable part of this positive transformation has come from Gwen's exceptional contribution during a particularly nasty engagement with Phaethon. One fateful morning, Phaethon launched a vicious invasion led by mechanized infantry backed by heavily-armored guards in what can only be described as a ring of steel around the city. It was a daunting, hopeless sight. Gwen, who had earlier been evacuated, returned in an airship which dropped barrage after barrage of explosives on confused enemy forces. Phaethon's panicked response provided Norah the perfect moment for an effective counterattack. Norah had witnessed her younger sister's extraordinary courage, skill, determination, and resourcefulness with a dawning realization: her sister was no longer a child in need of protective guidance.

The mission of the Icebreaker Alliance is to conquer these perilous lands and expand the horizons of human civilization to survive this long winter of raging winds and heavy snow. Hank belongs to the Icebreaker Alliance as one of its fearless pioneers.\n\nGifted with tremendous strength and great courage, Hank has developed immense willpower through his decades of pioneering adventures, including countless clashes with bandits amidst the lawless icefields. Through all those battles, Hank mastered the art of wielding a variety of hand tools as weapons, allowing him to take on up to ten enemies at a time.\n\nThe Icebreaker Alliance's most celebrated achievement has to be the establishment of Arena tournaments that swept across the tundra, of which Hank is a massive fan.

  "hero.hector.story": "Meet Hector, star of the arena, undisputed champion of the brave new world of gladiatorial combat in the post-Great Chill era. Here is a man whose search for worthy opponents, and their defeat, contributes much to his sense of honor and self-worth. Hector's approach to battle tends to be the approach of a furious thunderstorm or suppressive tornado, being crushed. Nevertheless, one should not miscontur Hector as a brute. On the contrary, he is renowned on the arena circuit for his comprehensive understanding of mixed fighting styles and psychological warfare. Combattant like Hector have been given increasing opportunities in recent times with new arenas awarding fighters for competitive skills, particularly with the rise of many new succesful cities. these opportunities have been tremendously exciting for Hecotr, particularly the prospect of more challenging adversaries.\n\nHector was born to a small, impoverished town without the protection even of a single Furnace. Times were tough and, unfortunately, there wasn't enough food to go around. Although just a child, Hector was left to fend for himself in the wilderness. It was a grim lesson on the consequences of fragility. Hector's first test arrived in the form of a hungry wolf separated from its pack. True to form, they fought and Hector won! The remarkable triumph caught the attention of a passing Chief named Garald. So impressed was Garald at the boy's abilities, he took Hector under his wing.\n\nChief Garald was a loyal member of the Icebreaker Alliance, a league that placed great importance on martial prowess. So it came as no surprise when he initiated Hector's training in the gladiatorial arts with an eye to eventually sponsoring him in the arena. Combined with Hector's natural aptitude, he soon became the strongest of Garald's formidable warriors. Like Garald, Hector too embraced the importance of militarism and strength. By contrast with Garald's strong city, Hector's hometown had already succumbed to the ice and snow long ago. Hector's exceptional strength, skills, and talents earned him immense arena prestige. If Hector feared anything, it must be the memory of his vulnerable youth and its unsettling possibilities. Hector began to believe all hardships in life can be attributed to weakness-whether his own or that of others.\n\nHector believed that it was weakness that distorted the heart, vulnerability that drove humans to the unspeakable. And Hector also developed a deep disdain for those that did not share his ideology until disaster prompted a more nuanced understanding. Hector was visiting an arena when an immense snowstorm suddenly swept through. Having survived, Hector watched other survivors, most of whom he regarded as feeble incompetents, band together to rescue many others including Hector's own colleagues. Although each was weak individually, together the town had formed a mighty rescue force. The incident invited some soul-searching. Hector had begun to reassess what true strength really means.",

  "hero.hendrik.name": "Hendrik",
  "hero.hendrik.story": "Captain Hendrik is a firm believer in the \"Sunken Nation\" legend. He has dedicated most of his life to navigating the depth of the ocean in darkness aboard his beloved giant submarine, The Neptune, only to search for the mythical, lost ruins. Occasionally, he surfaces to interact with the outside world, trading treasures found in the ocean for supplies. While he is well-mannered on one hand, he sometimes speaks and behaves eccentrically on the other. Many speculate that he has gone mad. After all, more than ten thousand hours spent exploring the deep sea must have taken a toll on him psychologically. Still, his profound knowledge of navigation and his remarkable talent in naval warfare are not to be doubted.\n\nHendrik was good-looking, wealthy, and full of charisma in his youth. However, the long-term lack of exposure to sunlight has utterly changed him. Now, he looks old and haggard, giving out a depressed vibe and an unpleasant smell that repels others. Hendrik is oblivious to the changes, as impractical items like mirrors are not found on The Neptune. One day while in town, he happened to catch sight of his own reflection and thought that some evil sorcerer had cast a spell on him or that mirror.\n\nMany have attempted to look for the \"Sunken Nation,\" mostly because of the treasure. However, Hendrik is different. He believes that the legendary lost nation is the destination for his soul. Hendrik was once an ambitious navigator who encountered a shipwreck during a voyage. As he sunk into the icy ocean along with the vessel, he caught a glimpse of an ancient underwater city before losing consciousness. By the time he woke up, he found himself in a coastal town. Some dismissed what he saw as a mere hallucination in his dying moments, yet no one could explain how he survived such a critical situation.\n\nHendrik was convinced that he was rescued by an envoy of the \"Sunken Nation,\" as he often heard calls from there in his dreams. Driven by this belief, he vowed to find the ancient city at all costs.\n\nHendrik returned to the sea area where the shipwreck happened, but his search for the \"Sunken Nation\" ended up futile. Nevertheless, he was not ready to give up just yet.\n\nHe broke the bank and built a gigantic submarine called \"The Neptune,\" believing that the ancient city had merely \"moved\" to another part of the sea. Although The Neptune was capable of traversing the seven seas, few were willing to be a part of his crazy plan, except for those treasure hunters who believed in the treasure of the \"Sunken Nation.\" Hendrik had no choice but to attack other ships and commandeered their crews to serve aboard his vessel. Those lucky survivors often mistook the assaults for attacks by sea monsters.\n\nThe time Hendrik spent talking to the murmurs in his dreams has granted him the special ability to communicate with the sea creatures around his submarine in astonishing ways, as if through telepathy. These sea inhabitants are his helpers whenever he finds himself in trouble.",

  "hero.hervor.story": "The icy peaks of Sathla tower majestically over the frigid far north. The cold land harbors a ruthless kingdom and Hervor is its Chieftain.\nThere are no Furnaces here, let alone Cities. There is only survival—survival in deep winter caverns or strongholds, easier in better days than now. But this is a strong people. They have always buried their weaker brethren in mountain tombs, long before the Great Chill.\nChieftainship of Sathla lends credibility to certain legends about Hervor—that her arms are as strong as tree trunks, her battle cries can trigger avalanches or her skin can survive steel. Of course, proving any would require a living challenger to Hervor's reign.\n\nChieftainship over Sathla is earned in every generation by a grueling series of arena duels.\nHervor's predecessor, Hraesvelgr Kinslayer, ruled for an astounding half a century. So resilient was Hraesvelgr that it was assumed that if he were not under the active protection of the ancestors or mountain gods, he was partly a demigod himself. People began to wonder which eagle flying over the valley might not be Hraesvelgr in disguise. His throne room was very well-adorned with challengers' heads and other body parts.\nFear was a tool and Hraesvelgr fanned the flame of legend. But even fear could not protect Hraesvelgr from the One Who Had Been Foretold and her miraculous return from the dead.\n\nThe witch's prophecy slithered through the tribal council like a curse: twins born under eternal night would one day feast upon the blood of a god. Hraesvelgr's wife had delivered during a lunar eclipse. Although painful, Hraesvelgr could not ignore any threat to his power. But rather than wield the knife himself, he would allow the mountain to do its work.\nCold and alone but for each other, challenged by the elements and predators, Hervor somehow survived. Years passed and their fate became a distant memory.\nThe chiefsguard stepped back in astonishment when the adult Hervor arrived one day to claim Hraesvelgr's throne. Surely this must be the will of the gods!\n\nThe battle between the undefeated father and the invincible daughter raged into the morning when, in the sight of all, Hraesvelgr's daughter did \"drink of the blood of a god\". The breaking of his so-called wings echoed alongside a new cry: Long live Chief Hervor!\nHervor had graduated as the most powerful queen in Sathla's history. Smarter and more cunning than her father, Hervor knew that someday she would share her father's fate as even the strongest oak withers—unless, that is, she chose the hard path and went abroad in search of a more enduring source of strength.",

With lances, swords, and cleansing steel, the Eagle Brigade can quickly crisscross the battlefield to win crucial victories for their cause.\nKarol may be one of the youngest in the Brigade's history but he has already achieved near legendary status among his men for mastery of war on horseback and long string of successes in war.\n\nKarol's hometown was known before the Great Chill for endless fertile fields and excellent stables, which continue to supply horses into the tundra. Humble families like Karol's and their frost-hardened horses have become the backbone of the Eagles and bulwark to a number of cities along the plains region.\nKarol was always interested in joining the Eagles. What boy wouldn't dream of being part of a heroic brigade defending people's lives? Yet visiting recruiters nearly rejected the rather short and stocky Karol until he proved them wrong with a stunning display of footwork that left the recruiter flat on his back.\n\nKarol's cohort received a baptism of fire when a group of mercenaries equipped with Helios Cannons and plated steam-tanks arrived with imperial ambitions. The Eagles were ill-prepared for such devilry. Karol's hometown would likely have fallen had a fierce blizzard not intervened.\nSnowstorms may be bad for horses, but they are even worse for siege engines and Helios Cannons. By morning the blizzard had eased and what was left of the defenders saw their chance. Karol sounded the horn for the defiant final charge of the Eagles.\n\nKarol rode with his commander into the thick of the action while a smaller group attacked from the flank. The battle lasted until the middle of the day until the invaders signaled a general retreat. Losses were terrible.\nKarol took up the standard from his fallen commander. He surveyed the victory.

  "hero.ligeia.name": "Ligeia",
  "hero.ligeia.story": "Ligeia is a lady of many talents, an excellent singer whose melodious songs are well-known across the Tundra. There are great chiefs who consider it an honor to have heard Ligeia perform. But there is still much more to Ligeia than meets the eye.\n\nLigeia seems to wield a strange power over Tundra society. Why do nobles bow to her every whim? Why do some chiefs whisper her name in fear? Some say she is a master manipulator who hypnotizes with her voice or weaves an invisible web of dark magic. If Ligeia has ever responded to such rumors, it is only with laughter or a declaration that undoubtedly some fans are indeed \"captivated\" by her heavenly voice.\n\nThe most commonly accepted story of Ligeia's singing skills, charm, sophistication, and breadth of knowledge is that she is an exiled noble from the last days of the Solaris Empire. Those doubtful (particularly noblemen's wives wary of her menacing presence) have occasionally dispatched investigators to uncover the layers of Ligeia's past. Strangely, none have ever returned compromising information and several have gone missing.\n\nLigeia does not hypnotize. She does not need to. Her actual skills are far more menacing.\n\nLigeia was second to none in her mastery of mechanical robotics during the last days of the Empire. Not all of the Empire's spider-mechs, which were mainly used to spy on nobles and obtain compromising information, were destroyed. It is Ligeia's ability to observe, blackmail, and emotionally manipulate that has granted what she desires more than anything else in the world: a life of ease and luxury. Of course, spider-mechs can be deployed in times of physical danger also.\n\nLigeia hides her past well. Nobody can know she was once a spymaster of the Solaris Empire.\n\nLigeia once had the unenviable role of watching the emperor's inner circle—acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the case of suspected dissidents (poison or spider bomb execution was preferred). Ligeia's unique skills helped her to navigate the collapse of the Empire better than most. Freedom and fortune became a simple matter of tracking down and assuming the identity of a noblewoman of similar appearance following the collapse.\n\nLigeia's new noble identity both allowed her to avoid enemies from the old regime and theoretically gave access to a large fortune. This facade has to be carefully managed, but leaves plenty of room for Ligeia to enjoy a better life than the Empire provided.

  "hero.lloyd.name": "Lloyd",
  "hero.lloyd.story": "Lloyd comes from Ostermore, the \"City of Artisans,\" famed for its astounding mechanical craftsmanship. His family is well-known for their clockmaking expertise. The grand clock tower in town, where he currently resides, is his father's masterpiece.\nAs the only son of a master craftsman, Lloyd showed exceptional talent from a young age, effortlessly mastering skills including calibrating the clock tower and repairing intricate pocket watches. His father, often engrossed in his work, had little time to spend with him. Therefore, Lloyd crafted a few \"friends\" for himself—a cheerful bronze bird and a singing robotic frog. With their companionship, Lloyd enjoyed a joyful childhood.\n\nSometime later, the town welcomed two new residents—a giant robot named Mr. Tin and a red-haired girl named Edith. Lloyd found his new neighbors fascinating and quickly befriended them. As they grew up and learned together, he developed a close bond with Edith, and he couldn't resist the urge to explore Mr. Tin's internal structure.\n\nOstermore had always been a peaceful place, until the arrival of some outsiders who called themselves Phaethon.\n\nThey came in search of the last remaining part of a so-called \"War Machine,\" intending to use it as a prototype for building a formidable army of robots. To this end, they seized control of the town and captured Edith and Mr. Tin.\nWrenches and hammers couldn't compete with bullets, but the craftsmen weren't ready to throw in the towel. As darkness fell, a quiet rebellion began to take shape in unseen corners...\n\nWhile the Phaethon soldiers changed shifts, the townspeople, aided by machines, launched a counterattack. Lloyd's father led the charge, and Lloyd himself, now a brave young man, was among the fighters.\nThe cuckoos disrupted the enemy's vision, and propeller bombs wreaked havoc behind them. In the end, the craftsmen reclaimed their town just before dawn. Lloyd spared Mr. Tin from being dismantled in the nick of time and freed Edith.\nHis father's injury cast a shadow over the victory—his movement was restricted by a severe spinal injury. Yet, neither Lloyd nor his father allowed this to bring them down. With Lloyd's improving skills, they believed he would one day craft the perfect exoskeleton, allowing the legendary craftsman to stand once more.",

  "hero.logan.name": "Logan",
  "hero.logan.story": "The lion-headed, steel-bodied Logan is one of the fiercest defenders of the Dawn Alliance.\n\nOne of the original Dawn Alliance founders, Logan could not be more different from his mostly academic colleagues. But what Logan lacks in refinement he makes up for in decisiveness; and what he lacks in gracefulness he makes up for with a fiery temperament that, as he puts it, gets results. But that is not to say he is a stranger to the ways of the scholar. Logan is one of the best engineers on the planet.\n\nThe steam-powered suit of armor that powers Logan across the tundra is also one of his own inventions—his gateway to a new life after a disabling injury. The mech is not exactly the most subtle of diplomatic instruments, but no one can deny the effectiveness of a metal fist when negotiations between the Dawn Alliance and less civil powers break down.\n\nLogan plays the role of a kind of a \"semi-vigilante\" and \"all-purpose guard\" for the Dawn Alliance. Logan is the brute force solution: a walking tank in place of careful schemes. Whatever one might say of Logan's \"often crazy\" battle plans, consistent victory on the battlefield speaks for itself. The power suit grants Logan capabilities ordinary warriors can scarcely imagine.\n\nLogan is no stranger to Phaethon, one of the Dawn Alliance's most implacable enemies. In fact, he was at one point made Lead Designer of Phaethon's daring Planetary Realignment Drive, which attempted to correct the Earth's course closer to the sun. It was Logan's good friend Bill who first opened his eyes to extraordinarily tragic human cost of the project. For the first time, Logan began to experience doubts about the end justifying the means. It was during this period of hesitation when Phaethon turned on Logan, removing his arm and almost his life. The Dawn Alliance rescued the grateful engineer. He quickly joined and swore himself to fixing the mistakes of his past.\n\nLogan is not a man who spends much time in regret. \"Talk is cheap\" and \"only action creates real change\" from Logan's point of view. Logan's contributions to mankind are already immense. Even his worst enemies, those persuaded by Phaethon that his abandonment of the Planetary Alignment Project was unforgivable, are probably benefiting from the warmth of one of Logan's Furnaces. Logan's masterful Furnace design has saved countless lives in the Great Chill, its design inspired by a Planetary Realignment Drive prototype. But no matter how many people Logan has helped, close friends often hear the same sad refrains from the bottom of another empty drink: \"It doesn't matter how much you do. You can't bring back the dead.\"",

As a bard, she visits from city to city to share the story of her bleak past to every corner of Icefield, hoping to lift the spirits of the people.\n\nBesides reciting poems and playing musical instruments, Lynn also excels in combat. Her instrument, \"Aira’s Tear,\" is modified from a weapon, so it can be used to play music and battle. During one of her performances, a group of bandits barged into the tavern, leaving everyone startled and confused. It was Lynn who fended off the bandits singlehandedly amid the music and gunfire. For that, some say that she should include her heroic deeds in the poems she recites.\n\nLynn’s best work is a song titled \"Aira’s Dream,\" but she rarely sings it. Those who are lucky enough to have heard the song claim that Lynn only sings it when she's drunk. As a result, plenty of \"seasoned drinkers\" have tried to make her perform the song by having a drinking contest with her. However, these overconfident challengers were long drunk before they achieved what they want.\n\nLynn was once a musician from a small town. After her town was invaded and occupied by the bandits, she lost her home and eventually became a mercenary. As the years passed, she became more skilled at wielding her weapon, but she had forgotten how to play her instrument. Memories of her hometown too faded away, with the scenery looking like a fantasy in her dreamland. Just like that, a former musician had evolved into a merciless mercenary captain. Her soul was never the same.\n\nIt was a day that ended Lynn’s career as a mercenary. Her team was ordered to besiege a town. Just as she was about to succeed, a song performed by an elderly musician came from within. The tune, which was buried deeply in Lynn’s memory, originated from her long-gone hometown—Aira. She thought no one would remember the song, just like how her hometown was forgotten.\n\nThe sentimental tune made the mercenaries pause in their tracks. Like their captain, tears were streaming down their faces. After everyone left, Lynn returned to the embrace of music and stayed with the elderly musician with a youthful spirit. It was only when the musician passed away did Lynn embark on her journey of becoming a bard.",

  "hero.magnus.story": "Magnus is one of those rare heroes who can confidently claim to have defeated an ice dragon den with his bare hands, tamed the untamable Beast of the Abyss, and single-handedly beat back an entire legion with a pistol and three mud-filled socks. Read all about it and more in Magnus' hot-selling autobiographical series \"The Adventures of Magnus the Magnificent\", which are allegedly \"based on true events\". Indeed, Magnus is already more myth than man in the eyes of countless youngsters all over the Tundra.\n\nSadly, Magnus has yet to confirm or deny which happenings in his \"autobiographical\" series are actually true events. By contrast, famed explorer Bahiti has on several occasions publicly described Magnus' claims as \"99% bunk\" and the work of an \"average explorer who for all of his skills remains no more than that\".\n\nBahiti and Magnus' testy public relationship was not always so heated. On at least one occasion the present-day foes saved each other's lives.\n\nExplorers to the end, Bahiti and Magnus once found themselves holed up in the ruins of an ancient city. Argument over finder's rights quickly gave way to panic on seeing an approaching mercenary group. Surrounded on all sides by ancient buildings that were either crumbling or riddled with traps, they formed an uneasy but effective alliance. Even Bahiti admitted it probably saved their lives—proving Magnus must have at least some skill. Their only regret? What little treasure they retrieved had not been worth the taking.\n\nSadly, this brief friendship soon crumbled under Bahiti's renewed mockery of \"Magnus the Magnificent's tall tales\", who returned to defending himself against Bahiti's \"conspiracy of skepticism\".\n\nMagnus' obsession with becoming the best explorer of his age must be traced back to his parents' legacy. Although ordinary hunters in their time, the couple always claimed to be descendants of the world's mightiest pioneers, and were convinced the same heroic blood flowed through their son's veins. It was not long before Magnus began to adopt the look and characteristics of his imagined ancestors—with swashbuckling style and heroic exaggeration. Mockery from other children had no effect.\n\nOf course, Magnus is not just a speaker of words but a doer also, who by vigorous training almost backs up the boasts of his youth. Unfortunately, his exaggerations have expanded with age too. As summed up by Jesse: \"Whatever you might say about Magnus, there's no denying his many stories have brought joy to countless kids.\"\n\nMagnus' impressive list of ancestors include a famous adventurer who explored the seven seas, every continent, priceless archaeological ruins and ancient treasures beyond number. Not even the autobiographical version of Magnus has done that. The only achievement his ancestral pioneer left incomplete? Reaching the edge of the world.\n\nNot to be outdone, Magnus has publicly sworn to fulfill his ancestor's unfinished dream by planting his family crest on the very edge of our planet. This great feat, he has declared, shall be performed come what may—even if, as some have warned, the Earth is actually round.",

There may also be goods of extraordinary value for the discerning buyer.\n\nMia's shows are legendary—featuring strongmen, illusionists, and vanishing ninjas from far-away lands. But it is their leader, Mia, in the role of a soothsayer, who usually captures the public's imagination. It is said that her magic grants clairvoyant vision of a person's past, present, and future. It is a skill Mia uses to great effect and profit.\n\nAs everyone knows, there is no such thing as a \"real\" soothsayer. Yet no matter how many times sceptics have tried to disprove Mia's abilities, her naysayers have yet to explain the source of her unnerving accuracy.\n\nMia's convoy is the source of not only interesting trinkets, but also intel on other Cities, the Dawn Alliance, Phaethon, and other important factions, individuals, and old Imperial remnants. Traveling widely may be one factor, but Mia's buyers are still not quite sure exactly how she obtains so much valuable intel. Its accuracy, however, is never in doubt. But Mia also has a conscience. She will not trade such secrets except with those she believes deserve her trust.\n\nBahiti is one of many intrepid explorers often drawn to Mia's soothsayer hut, wondering aloud on each occasion whether the Mia's levitating crystal ball is really a result of \"witchcraft\". Mia always responds that it is merely a trick that careful observation will quickly unravel. Bahiti is one of the keenest minds in the Dawn Alliance, and yet somehow has never been able to locate the mechanism behind Mia's \"parlor tricks\".\n\nMia's background, as well as the identities of many of her mysterious followers, are also shrouded in mystery. No one quite knows the story behind her ragtag—and often scary—cabal. According to one legend, bandits were about to raid Mia's convoy when they accidentally observed the unmasked face of one of the caravan's frightening guards. Whatever the bandits saw, it made such an impression they fled the scene without further ado. It's difficult to unravel the mystery surrounding Mia, her abilities, and her followers.

After all, she can do snowball fights, bobsled runs, and build a snowman whenever she wants. But most importantly, the snowy world is all Molly has ever known.\n\nIn fact, not much is known about her life before Dawn Alliance.\nBahiti found Molly during a peacekeeping operation against a Phaethon stronghold. The incredible part of the story is, Bahiti claims Molly's combat instincts were key to the team's successful escape from the heavily guarded fortress.\n\nAccording to Bahiti, Molly was an essential part of Phaethon’s combat program. This also explains her peculiar weapon - a snowball launcher. Although Molly seems much more interested in using it for snowball fights.\n\nBahiti's successful rescue owed much to his ability to win Molly's trust. When a Phaethon soldier's arrow injured Bahiti, Molly flew into a rage, took down all the guards with ease, and then fled with the members of Dawn Alliance.\n\nMolly has a strange affinity for the cold. She has no problem enduring freezing conditions. Moreover, her excellent combat intuition and unusually strong fighting techniques (particularly on snow and ice) have truly piqued the Dawn Alliance's interest. What’s the source of Molly's preternatural abilities? The investigation is still ongoing.\n\nIt was later revealed that Phaethon first discovered Molly in a large underground facility, where she was hibernating in a strange ‘pod’. Some believe Molly is connected to the planet in a mysterious and unexplained way.\n\nWhen she awakened, Molly had no memory of her past, but she exhibited superhuman vitality and physical strength.

  "hero.norah.name": "Norah",
  "hero.norah.story": "Norah's three defining qualities must be her remarkable courage, leadership of a light mechanized brigade, and identity as one of very few truly exceptional leaders in the Dawn Alliance.Norah and her brigade often penetrate deep into enemy territory with the speed of an arrow,undertaking reconnaissance missions, strikes, and rescue operations. And the combination of Norah's tactical brilliance, timing on the battlefield, and weapons expertise makes her an absolute nightmare for Phaethon.Norah's exceptional calmness under pressure and decisive demeanor impress even the most seasoned soldiers-even against near-insurmountable odds. If anything could possibly disturb Norah's resolve, it must be fears for her younger sister Gwen's safety.\n\nNorah may have been part of the same training cohort as Bahiti at the Academy, but the two could not be more different. Unlike Bahiti, Norah is a a master battlefield commander and tactician with little interest in anything unrelated to the intricacies of fighting since her scientist father's tragic fate.Norah has developed the firm belief no amount of knowledge can compare to what truly matters:safeguarding those she holds dear.\n\nNorah was only a child when she spotted Phaethon's columns advancing toward her father's laboratory.All her father's brilliance, his vast wealth of knowledge, proved powerless in saving him from the dreadful fate that followed. Norah stood resolute by her father's side, receiving his final testament and instructions on how to flee, all while her baby sister Gwen remained cradled in swaddling clothes. With aheavy heart, Norah carried Gwen to their father's steam-powered sled and escaped with the great\ndriving skills he had carefully fostered.Eventually, she stopped to look back at the lab. All she could see was rising smoke.\n\nNorah and her sister were rescued by her father's colleagues at the Dawn Alliance. This encounter ignited a burning hatred for Phaethon, an unyielding dedication to her younger sister, and zeal for the path of the warrior-soldier within Norah.In the course of time Norah's younger sister has become something of a weak spot in Norah's rigid life-or perhaps Norah's only soft spot. Unlike Norah, Gwen showed extraordinary talent as an inventor, a challenge for Norah who would have preferred Gwen to focus more on ordinary combat skills. Yet Norah could not bring herself to spar against Gwen even in a controlled setting, the thought of an accident and fresh grief too much to bear. Yet Norah has since grown to value Gwen's ingenuity on the battlefield, especially when rescuing fellow soldiers.And over time Norah has gradually come to terms with the reality that Gwen has found her own strong and independent footing.",

For that, people always stayed away from Dr. Philly, until a plague struck several years ago.\n\nThe deadly disease hit the Cities without warning. The Chiefs designated a village as the quarantine spot for all those infected. Although, without proper resources, people in the village were practically left to die. When all hope was lost for the sick and forsaken, Dr. Philly chose to enter the village in search of a cure.\n\nAnd she succeeded. She was dubbed a miracle worker, an angel of the Cities. Philly spends a lot of time in the City graveyards and often faced accusations of grave robbery. Her studies of dead bodies are now encouraged by authorities, as her discoveries often lead to new cures for diseases. Philly is still regarded as a somewhat mysterious figure for spending long hours at the morgue and apothecary. This air of mystery made some people believe that Philly possesses supernatural power against diseases.\n\nThe truth was far more mundane. Philly was a promising medical researcher in the academy before a plague claimed the lives of all her families. Philly was the only survivor in her house. After that, she became determined to push boundaries and find new treatments for the plague.\n\nPhilly threw herself back into her studies with a vengeance. She has marked out disease and death as her personal enemies. And with anger came courage to face whatever dangers head on. However, Philly's goal is not just to conquer disease. She believes that one day she will be able to find a way to reverse death, even to the extent of bringing her family back...",

Reina might not stand out at first sight, but she is, only known to a few, an excellent juggler during the day and a ninjutsu master at night.\n\nReina is a changed woman once she puts on her ninja attire. Leaving no traces when moving around, she is good at disguising herself and sneaking into places. Her target could hardly notice her presence even if she were close at hand. With this amazing skill, Reina has collected a lot of vital intel for Mia.\n\nUndoubtedly, assassination is Reina’s best skill. Whether using a ninjaken, a sword, or her bare hands, she can easily finish off her target without causing a stir.\n\nReina is Mia’s right-hand woman as well as her best friend. From time to time, some forces will go after Mia and the other merchants because they have discovered too many secrets.

Reina always goes all out for Mia, not only to repay Mia’s kindness of taking her in but also for the sake of their close friendship formed during their expedition.\n\nReina was unconscious when Mia met her for the first time, Mia's caravan took Reina in, and saved her life. At first, Reina was wary about things around her and was unwilling to interact with other people. It was Mia’s pet cat, Bastet, that opened Reina’s heart and provided her with warmth. Now, Reina and Bastet have become inseparable.\n\nReina was an orphan raised by the Phaethon Mercenaries. Together with her childhood friends, she was trained to be an assassin. Despite performing her duties with dedication, she became a target to be eliminated after finding out a crucial secret of the mercenaries.

In addition, her performances also seem to have magic that can healthe soul, and make gloomy and hurt souls find joy again.\n\nHowever, like the other members of the caravan,Renee has secrets of her own too. No one knows what's hidden behind that mask covered with paints\n\nOnce, Mia's caravan was attacked by a group of bandits but they cried and ran screaming after seeing Renee's face.\n\nBecause of this, all sorts of rumors spread about Renee's face. Some curious people sneaked into the tent set up by the caravan to have a look at Renee's terrifying face, but there was nobody in there. They turned back and were about to make their escape when they ran into Renee, who was returning. Unprepared, the intruders fell to the floor in fright, peeking between their fingers at Renee whose ghastly face was... not ghastly at all, but kind and friendly. They were not hurt due to their reckless actions either.\n\nIt was not a ghastly face that had scared off those bandits, but a potion that made people fall inton ightmares called \"Dream Mold\" that Renee uses to fight and to defend herself.\n\nRenee has some immunity to these substances due to long term exposure to unstable Fire Crystals as a victim of an evil experiment, where her mind had been damaged. As Philly said, \"No one can make someone who's already insane go mad after all.\"Renee is not sad about her state, since she sees the world as a fairytale kingdom full of rainbows and lush green nature. Her companions are animals and elves, and those with ill-intent are transformed into evil magical creatures. In Renee's view, she is in a wonderful land fighting bad monsters that want to disturb the peace.\n\nLong ago, Renee was a resident of the lost city of Arcadia. As a researcher, she worked towards finding a way to communicate with the will of the world with Fire Crystals, and to uncover the truth of why the world had changed.\n\nRenee was captured when Phaethon sacked Arcadia, and forced to forcibly connect with the world's will, though her research was not yet perfected. Her will was assaulted horribly and destroyed in the process of coming into contact with a large number of unstable Fire Crystals, and her mind shattered completely.

Faced with such injustice, some chose to put up with the hardship while others rose in rebellion—Rufus belonged to the latter.\nAfter the fall of the old kingdom, Rufus became the leader of a mercenary group. Having suffered under oppression and driven by a strong sense of justice, he never treated the people with violence like some of his peers. It was this quality that attracted honorable warriors like Gina, who chose to join him and become his followers.\nRegrettably, Rufus' journey came to an abrupt end one day. After receiving a secret commission, he left with an expedition team and was never seen again.\n\nRufus was entrusted with escorting his client through a remote valley into the underground. As the mysterious client put it, the outcome of that trip would determine the fate of the entire world.\nDespite thorough preparations, the journey was more perilous than Rufus had anticipated. The mist shrouding the valley seemed to take a toll on the mind, causing the expeditioners to experience hallucinations, lose track of time, and suffer memory distortions. One by one, they fell behind and disappeared...\nBy the time Rufus finally arrived at the narrow fissure leading to the underworld, his client and he were the last ones standing.\n\nIt was a whole new world beneath the surface.\nAfter traversing a vast jungle of giant fungi, wading through winding rivers, and evading the pursuit of underground dwellers, they arrived at their destination—a seemingly ordinary relic. The client introduced it as a machine created by an ancient civilization, capable of awakening the entire planet.\nRufus thought his client had lost his mind, but after all the hardships they endured to reach the place, he still gave his all to help activate the relic. Once all the necessary steps were completed, the relic came to life, and something appeared to awaken. As Rufus gazed at \"the presence\" through the open stone gate, both he and his client were engulfed by a dazzling light...\n\nWithin the light, Rufus witnessed the birth, rise, and fall of civilizations in an endless cycle... as though he was having a dream. When he finally woke up, he couldn't tell how much time had passed. His client was nowhere to be seen, and the relic further deteriorated. The memories of his experience in the light began to fade, leaving him with nothing but unanswered mysteries as he walked away.\nWith the fissure to the surface gone, Rufus made his home in the underground settlement, earning the respect of its inhabitants through his bravery. Years passed before another expedition team found him and brought him back to the surface. Everything felt unfamiliar, but he took solace in seeing The Eagles thriving under Gina's leadership.",

The rundown vessel is spared from frequent breakdowns, thanks to her exceptional skills.\n\nJust like the captain, Sonya longs to find the \"Sunken Nation\", but she is only interested in the treasure. Some are surprised by her belief in the elusive legend, given how rational and wise she is. The truth is, Sonya had already secured clues leading to the underwater nation from various ancient ruins around the world even before joining The Neptune. She believes she will find her long-desired treasure with her wisdom and Hendrik's vessel.\n\nInitially, Sonya boarded The Neptune as a prisoner. When Captain Hendrik realized she could let herself free using her skills and intelligence, and no one could stop her, he simply allowed her to roam freely on the vessel.\n\nEveryone knows that Sonya and Hendrik are merely using each other. Once there is a conflict of interests, they will turn against each other. At least for now, their \"partnership\" has been going well. The crew members find Sonya intimidating not only because of her physical prowess but also because she knows everyone's secrets and weaknesses and how to exploit them.\n\nSonya's desire for wealth stems from her past. As a distant relative of the old kingdom's royal family, she used to live an extravagant life but lost everything on the day Sunfire Castle fell. Years of homelessness and destitution gave her a hard time and stripped her of dignity. Although she has gradually mastered the law of survival in the icy post-apocalyptic world, she finds herself increasingly convinced that money is the sole path to redemption and the ultimate truth! Hence, she spares no effort in seeking the opportunities to get rich.\n\nHer outstanding knowledge and combat skills gained during her time as a wanderer drew invitations from the Dawn Alliance, the mercenaries, and even the Phaethon. However, she was not satisfied with the \"meager\" pay they offered, so she focused all her attention on the treasures across the world instead.\n\nDuring her treasure hunt, she stumbled upon clues regarding a \"Sunken Nation.\" She intentionally got herself captured by Captain Hendrik, as she needed his expensive vessel to locate the mysterious realm hidden underwater. She believes that once she discovers the lost treasure, she will become the wealthiest person in the entire tundra. She will then rebuild the kingdom of Solaris and crown herself as the new queen.",

  "hero.viveca.name": "Viveca",
  "hero.viveca.story": "Commander of the Night's Guard, Viveca is a cold and stern leader who just so happens to also be a marksman with perfect accuracy. Her lifelong mission is to contain the disaster triggered by the Blood Moon plague, to confine it within the mist-shrouded domain of the Abandoned City—a place she once called home—and she will stop at nothing to achieve her mission.\nFacing the mutated beings that emerge from the mist, most would be petrified, as those enemies defy all understanding. Viveca, on the other hand, faces them without the slightest flinch, as she knows their weaknesses. Under her fearless leadership, members of the Night's Guard have also found the courage to face the darkness head-on.\n\nViveca is usually cold, quiet, and aloof. She keeps most people at arm's length, and her only companion besides Freya, Dr. Philly, and a few Night's Guard officers is her pet raven, Veilwing. Her personality seems innate, as if she were simply born without emotions, but Freya knows the truth: Viveca has experienced too much trauma to let her heart remain open and vulnerable.\n\nIf Viveca is usually cold, then on the battlefield, she's utterly frigid and ruthless. When the Blood Moon Plague broke out in the Abandoned City, she had to slaughter her very own friends because they'd mutated into inhuman horrors. Even today, she does not hesitate to pull the trigger when faced with allies who've been infected.\n\nThe survivors of the Abandoned City established a new settlement right outside the mist: New Metiya. A mysterious stranger later claimed the plague was not a curse, but an opportunity for transformation—an idea that has deeply unsettled Viveca after witnessing signs of intelligence within the infected.",

  "hero.wayne.name": "Wayne",
  "hero.wayne.story": "Wayne has always kept to himself as a bounty hunter, and he is as capable as he is experienced. He always completes his missions precisely and efficiently like a stone-cold machine, and never utters a word more than necessary.\nHe is an excellent sharpshooter with razor reflexes,making him one of the best shooters on the ice fields. According to Bahiti, Wayne can do a quick draw at 100 paces and hit multiple coins thrown in the air in quick succession. However, he prefers to deal with his opponents with his modified Power Boomerang, which is a more effective tool for him to turn in the targets \"intact\" to the employer.\nSometimes, he gives his combative and resistant \"prey\" a fair fighting chance. He's never lost, of course.\nWayne has practically no friends, and doesn't view \"bonding with other people\" as something that's necessary. He also says that he accepts various arduous and dangerous missions—mostly pursuing vicious bandits—not out of a sense of justice, but for the money.\nAs a long-time \"business partner,\" Greg the judge is thankful that Wayne probably has his own moral code and doesn't blindly accept all commissions, and doesn't become an accomplice to evil \"for the money.\" \n\"I'm from another world—a world that no longer exists,\" said Wayne when one of his acquaintances asked about his past. This absurd statement wasn't taken seriously, but it wasn't entirely untrue. The town where Wayne was born and raised had indeed met its demise under extreme circumstances. His beloved home was lost to history, and all the people and things he had loved had turned to dust. Because of this, Wayne closed himself off so that he would not form connections, and stepped onto the path of a lone wolf.\nWayne's \"hunts\" do not always go smoothly. On a hunt for Zenobia, Queen of Violence, he was shot and fell to the bottom of a valley. A young mountain maid named Matilda saved him and brought him home to nurse him back to health. After losing her husband, Matilda and her young son depended on each other to live, and the arrival of a stranger brought much color to their daily grind. Just as Wayne recovered, Zenobia and her cronies invaded Matilda's village. Expecting helpless victims, Zenobia was stopped short by her old nemesis. Wayne captured the vicious criminal and bid farewell to Matilda. Even he did not realize that small change had been wrought in a small part of his heart.",

  "hero.wuming.name": "Wu Ming",
  "hero.wuming.story": "No one knows his real name, but every town has hard of his legend-\n\nAs a warrior who wanders the land, Wu Ming has made a name for himself as a martial artist. He reached a high level of perfection in his skills, and is not adraid to use his strength to help the weak. His chivalry has earned him an excellent reputation, and with his Dragonslayer in hand, he is a terror to the opportunistic bandits who roam the Tundra.\n\nThough he has become accustomed to the life of a wanderer, he still stays temporily in poorer towns to teach Survivor how to protec themselves. After all, like an old saying from his distant hometown, \"Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\"\n\nWu Ming is skilled not just in martial arts, but in music and the arts. However, what people praise more about him is his humbleness and amiable personality. He would even play the role of a schoolteacher in the town sometimes and teach children how to read, write, and count. He also tells them fantastical myths from foreign lands. Few know that Wu Ming was once a person who was completely different than his current self.\n\nHis past self's only pursuit in life was to go down in history as the \"World's Number One Master.\" For this purpose, he studied hard, visited many renowned masters, and learned from all schools of thought. He was already gifted in martial arts, and his obsession with it made him a formidable opponent even in his youth, remaining undefeated until he met that older person.\n\nThis older person once traveled the world but now lived in an ordinary town. Hearing talk of this person's unparalleled martial art skills, the fighting spirit was rekindled in Wu Ming's empty heart and he stepped forth to challenge this person. His challenge ended not in victory, and he tasted defeat with the sword, spear, and halberd against that person's stick. After his consecutive losses, Wu Ming became obsessed with surpassing this mighty opponent.\n\nFor several years after that first challenge, Wu Ming challenged that older person annually, and was defeated every time. He could not figure out how victory still eluded him though he had surpassed his opponent in strength, agility, and skill.\n\nDuring his last challenge, a group of bandits called Reapers invaded the town where the older person lived. Wu Ming tried to flee-human flesh is no shield against heavy mech after all-but the older person, with his strength, struck the invaders with his stick and subdued three Reapers, ensuring the town's safety. However, he had also exhausted his strength in this last battle and death came swiftly upon him. Wu Ming, witnessing this event, realized the true meaning of being a warrior: True righteous ideals and belief are the key to transcendence. And so, he took on the mantle of his late opponent and embarked on his journey of chivalry under the alias \"Wu Ming\", or \"The Nameless One\".",

  "hero.xura.name": "Xura",
  "hero.xura.story": "How else should survivors interpret Xura's strange mask, unusual clothing, and odd accent except that he comes from a distant kingdom, far from the present-day Tundra? If only some well-versed explorer could explain which one! Enquiring minds want to know—Xura remains tight-lipped about his origins.\n\nOf course, the short traveler is welcome everywhere anyway. Xura has tried to emulate the language of the Tundra and mount the seemingly insurmountable cultural differences between his own way of thinking and the locals' as best he can. Added to this is Xura's ever-friendly attitude and, most importantly, the extraordinary herbal remedies with which he has cured many survivors to the bafflement of city physicians.\n\nWhere did Xura get his herbs? Most of the plants have never been seen on the Tundra, nor can grow there, adding further fuel to the rumors that Xura hails from a place utterly different to the frigid hellscape stretching from horizon to horizon. More curious still is Xura's thirst for knowledge about anything and everything to do with the Tundra, its people, flora, and fauna. His special rapport with local animals has often been remarked upon, as well as a strange willingness to test the medicinal properties of random plants—he often eats them on the spot.\n\nCertain researchers from the Dawn Alliance on a mission to uncover Xura's origins have traced the symbols in his journal to a long-lost tribe known as the \"Windbreakers\". Xura's mask appears to be shamanistic, indicating a spiritual role around the \"Gaia Spirit\" in addition to his medical responsibilities.\n\nSurviving records of the Windbreakers are scarce, but paint a picture of a tribe on the verge of extinction even before the Great Chill. Xura's arrival has at least settled the debate on whether the Windbreakers survived. It also points the way to several promising possibilities.\n\nLong before the world experienced a calamitous chill, the Windbreakers under the foresight of their witch-doctors migrated to a vast underground cave system anchored by the \"Great Tree\".\n\nThe Windbreakers found new sources of heat and sustenance even without the warming rays of the sun, especially from the tree's strange roots, and adapted to their new subterranean life. As fate would have it, their odd choice of dwelling sheltered the tribe from the worst of the Great Chill.\n\nYet Elders say the life force of the Great Tree is fading. And only a legendary Fire Crystal can provide revitalizing nourishment. Xura may only be a recent initiate, but on his shoulders now falls the burden of wandering a strange land to save his people.",

His designs were brilliant, and his reputation was oustanding. However, his appearance... let’s just say Zinman had no time for such trivial things. If not for the Great Chill, he would no doubt reach ever greater heights in his field of study.\n\nWhile many of Zinman's former colleagues settled in the nearest Cities, Zinman mysteriously vanished for several years. When he showed himself again, he became a key member of the powerful Dawn Alliance. Under the alliance, Zinman developed new defensive engineering techniques and improvements to the City Furnace. He takes pride in these less artistic but highly practical structures.\n\nZinman rarely speaks of his family, but people knew of the sudden passing of his daughter. It had always been her dream to see a magnificent greenhouse full of all kinds of flowers. This project was eventually approved by the President of Sunfire Castle after Zinman spent years petitioning for it. Nearly a decade of work on the unfinished greenhouse was destroyed in the chaos following the Great Chill.\n\nInitially, Zinman could not let go of his daughter's dream greenhouse. Then reality beckoned, and he realized survival is everyone’s top priority in the frozen world.\n\nZinman's post-Chill inventions include shelters with enhanced snow cover and conversion kits to turn nail guns into effective weapons. Although he is helping a lot of survivors with his knowledge, Zinman is painfully aware of his failure to fulfill the promise to his daughter.\n\nAfter joining Dawn Alliance as the chief architect, Zinman found hope and purpose again. He was glad to use his architectural knowledge to save countless lives, families, and cities. The smile on their faces offered immeasurable comfort to Zinman. He still dreams that one day far in the future, he would build that greenhouse, as an act of remembrance for his family...",
