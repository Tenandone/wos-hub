    "buildings.furnace.meta.description": "Just a big, and probably dangerous, bonfire at the beginning. This is your town HQ and the first construct you open. Its level determines both the max level you can upgrade other buildings to along with which buildings you can open up and when you open them up. Upgrading it will increase the amount of heat it produces and also increases your power.\n\nThe Furnace has a secondary function that is equally as important: keeping your Survivors warm during the day, night, and during snowstorms. This helps prevent your Survivors from becoming sick. When sick, your Survivors will not be able to work until they are well again.",

    "buildings.embassy.meta.description": "This is one of your Alliance buildings. The purpose of it is to have a place to keep reinforcements that are sent to you by Alliance members. It is also what dictates the amount of help you can get from your Alliance members when it comes to Construction, Research, and Healing.\n\nUpgrading this building is typically a requirement to upgrade your Furnace to the next level. Upgrading the Embassy increases the total amount of reinforcements your Alliance can send you, the amount of times your Alliance members can help you speed up Construction, Research, and Healing, and boosts your power.",

    "buildings.commandcenter.meta.description": "Another Alliance building. Upgrading this building increases the total number of troops you can have in a rally you start and increases the number of troops you can send in your marches.

    "buildings.infirmary.meta.description": "This is where your injured troops go to recover. Upgrading this building increases Infirmary capacity and also boosts your power.\n\nKeep the Infirmary at the same level as your HQ to maximize capacity. This matters because if the Infirmary fills up, your troops will start to die in battle.\n\nUpgrading the Ward Expansion technology in the Growth tab of the Research Center also increases Infirmary capacity. Researching Bandaging, also in Growth, reduces healing time.",

    "buildings.infantrycamp.meta.title": "Infantry Camp",
    "buildings.infantrycamp.meta.description": "This building is used to train and upgrade Infantry. You can unlock it at Furnace Lv. 7.\n\nInfantry Camps upgrade alongside your Furnace and are usually required to upgrade your Furnace to the next level. Each upgrade increases Training Capacity, how many troops you can train at once, reduces training time, and boosts your power.\n\nAt certain levels, you will unlock higher tier troops. Once you unlock T5 troops, you can promote lower tier troops up to the highest trainable tier.\n\nResearching Camp Expansion in the Growth tab of the Research Center further increases Training Capacity. Researching Training Tools, also in Growth, reduces the time needed to train a batch of troops.",
