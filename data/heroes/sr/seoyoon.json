  "storyHtml": "<p>Seo-yoon has always believed in the transformative power of music. Likewise, music and other higher forms of entertainment have always been a rare commodity in this new icy world.<br />\n<br />\nVirtually everyone can appreciate the efforts of Seo-yoon and her merry band of minstrels, as they are sometimes called, in travelling from settlement to settlement in echoes of touring musicians of the old world. Certainly, plenty of merriment, laughter, songs of joy and dance will be found in every community they visit.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon strikes most folk as a gentle soul on first impression, humble with a certain elegance of spirit. Only the most discerning or those who know Seo-yoon well will recognize the iron stubbornness and bravery behind her eyes. Fewer still would know of Seo-yoon's skills as a close quarters combatant with a proven track record of defending her companions in need, or the evil uses to which her drumsticks can be turned when the situation calls for it.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon's drumming skills are probably her most legendary. A smart Chief should not underestimate the inspirational effect of music on troops, even troops who seem to lack a single musical bone in their body.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no substitution for talent. Even if Seo-yoon has practiced her instruments for many years, what she possesses is nothing less than a special kind of musical magnetism, an ability to channel her heart and soul into a language all listeners can hear. Few drummers generate the responses that Seo-yoon excites after a few minutes.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon owes much of her fame to a privileged upbringing in one of the wealthiest Cities in the Tundra, a relative utopia compared to many others overrun by cold and wind. This afforded her the opportunity to study music and choreography to her heart's content, at which she had already showed exceptional promise as a young girl. Seo-yoon's ability to play nearly any instrument after a short practice session did not escape her father's proud notice.<br />\n<br />\nA strict survivalist, Seo-yoon's father was a stern but kindly man who considered it his duty to prepare his only daughter for every eventuality that may come to pass in the new world. Musical practice was always followed by rigorous combat training that, if all went well, would never be used. Fate had other plans.<br />\n<br />\nSeo-yoon's wealthy Settlement was raided by a large group of bandits in her late teenage years. Caught by surprise, most of the city's defenders were quickly massacred, including her father, while others fled on foot from their homes into the icy wilderness. The situation seemed utterly hopeless, but something in Seo-yoon refused to yield. And in that stubbornness she found hope. She took to her instruments and began playing a rousing martial theme that she kept up through the night until early morning, although there was little sign of any significant response.<br />\n<br />\nIt was only when dawn came, and the beautiful golden sun lit up the edges of the horizon that the Settlement's survivors looked around at each other and realized they were still great in number. This might just be the occasion for a miracle. Seo-yoon called for volunteers and, one by one, brave warriors pledged themselves into a ragtag counter-attack force. The invaders, many drunk on the town's wine or napping from the heavy celebrations following their so-called victory, were unprepared. The rest is history.<br />\n<br />\nIn the end, Seo-yoon had played a critical role in winning back the resolve of her people and their home, to which she was given a hero's welcome. Seo-yoon was not just a musician now, but an inspiring warrior and commander.</p>",
