  "story": "How else should survivors interpret Xura's strange mask, unusual clothing, and odd accent except that he comes from a distant kingdom, far from the present-day Tundra? If only some well-versed explorer could explain which one! Enquiring minds want to know—Xura remains tight-lipped about his origins.\n\nOf course, the short traveler is welcome everywhere anyway. Xura has tried to emulate the language of the Tundra and mount the seemingly insurmountable cultural differences between his own way of thinking and the locals' as best he can. Added to this is Xura's ever-friendly attitude and, most importantly, the extraordinary herbal remedies with which he has cured many survivors to the bafflement of city physicians.\n\nWhere did Xura get his herbs? Most of the plants have never been seen on the Tundra, nor can grow there, adding further fuel to the rumors that Xura hails from a place utterly different to the frigid hellscape stretching from horizon to horizon. More curious still is Xura's thirst for knowledge about anything and everything to do with the Tundra, its people, flora, and fauna. His special rapport with local animals has often been remarked upon, as well as a strange willingness to test the medicinal properties of random plants—he often eats them on the spot.\n\nCertain researchers from the Dawn Alliance on a mission to uncover Xura's origins have traced the symbols in his journal to a long-lost tribe known as the \"Windbreakers\". Xura's mask appears to be shamanistic, indicating a spiritual role around the \"Gaia Spirit\" in addition to his medical responsibilities.\n\nSurviving records of the Windbreakers are scarce, but paint a picture of a tribe on the verge of extinction even before the Great Chill. Xura's arrival has at least settled the debate on whether the Windbreakers survived. It also points the way to several promising possibilities.\n\nLong before the world experienced a calamitous chill, the Windbreakers under the foresight of their witch-doctors migrated to a vast underground cave system anchored by the \"Great Tree\".\n\nThe Windbreakers found new sources of heat and sustenance even without the warming rays of the sun, especially from the tree's strange roots, and adapted to their new subterranean life. As fate would have it, their odd choice of dwelling sheltered the tribe from the worst of the Great Chill.\n\nYet Elders say the life force of the Great Tree is fading. And only a legendary Fire Crystal can provide revitalizing nourishment. Xura may only be a recent initiate, but on his shoulders now falls the burden of wandering a strange land to save his people.",
