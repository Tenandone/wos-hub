  "story": "Gordon is a terrifying presence despite his scholarly demeanor, particularly for those he deems not to have the best interest of the Tundra's civilians and its cities at heart. Plunderers and pillagers, in other words, have much to fear from Gordon's reputation as the 'great poisoner of our time\".\nThe strongest shield and the toughest armor will do nothing against Gordon's weapon of choice: the slow toxin for the man he wishes to immobilize or elixir of pain for the man he wishes to torture without leaving a mark. Nor does the poison-resistant Gordon have anything to fear from his own devices. As Bahiti has noted with joy: \"We should thank our lucky stars Gordon only deploys his unusual talents on those seeking to do harm.\"\n\nBy day Gordon does nothing more adventurous than teaching, by wich he shares his extraordinary scientific knowledge with the most brilliant minds of the next generations. His students have little to fear from the erudite professor who has killed thousands, because his reputation is improved by his teachning ability and charisma.\nIt is only outside the city, against those threatening the lives of innocent, that Gordon exercices his peculiar poisons without mercy against the \"locusts\" as he describes them. And in so doing he becomes a madman, willing to deploy fast-acting poisons and deadly mists across every corner of the battlefield to asphyxiate those who do not \"deserve\" to live.\n\nGordon's strange mix of elegance and rage can be traced back to his horrific experience as mayor of a wealthy city turned hellish wasteland through the efforts of Phateon and Dr. Toxin Theodore. To Dr. Toxin, Phaethon represented the hole to his key of continued scientific experimentation, ideological difference notwithstanding. Dr. Toxin ordered a full-scale chemical bombardment. He had finally found his \"experimental subjects.\" As mayor, Gordon was selected for special treatment-he was submerged in a cellar filled with a toxic goo of unknown effect. There he was left to rot for seven days and nigths by cruel observers eager to understand more. It was seven days of pure torture.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\". This was certainly true in Gordon's case.\nSeven days later Gordon's experimenters had an answer: the chemical goo was painful,yes, but produced no long-lasting physical deformities. And when the Dawn Alliance finally wrested control of the ruins from Dr. Toxin's hands, Gordon was surprised to discover he was hardly injured and, unlike most other residents, remained of sound mind. Furthermore, his lengthy immersion seemed to have made him immune to many other common toxins as well.\nGordon's life mission is now to inflict such horros on Dr. Toxin Theodore as to horrify the world, yet his thirst for revenge has not twisted his mind beyond reason. He knows the past cannot be fixed, but feelsa moral duty to prevent similar tragedies from occuring. Thus, Gordon has become a great crusader against the evil locusts and to \"return their poison for poison\".",
