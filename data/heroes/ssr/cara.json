  "story": "With Cara of the Oestermore Postal Service, the mail always gets through.\nThe red-headed wonder girl can be seen flying over and between the towns of Ostermore at different times of the day or night courtesy of her steam-powered air-broom, delivering letters and much-needed smiles to survivors anxiously awaiting the mail. Children may chase her down the street and ask her to perform a magic trick, but the only real witchery here is the magic of great charm and talent.\n\nIn these strange times, the best postal workers come with considerable firepower. Life for even the privileged City-dweller isn't easy. Bandits and wild predators are always on the prowl, and many a time has Cara had to intervene directly or with a broom-based diversion while reinforcements arrive.\n\nCara always finds time in her busy delivery schedule to pursue the twin interests of baking and sleuth of Oestermore's urban legends. The more her friends urge Cara to drop an issue, the more she insists on pursuing it.\n\nCara was hailed as a hero upon her return, which went some way to relieving her self-imposed feelings of inadequacy.",
