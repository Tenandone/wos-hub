  "story": "The old kingdom still stood firm during Rufus' youth. At that time, the aristocrats lived extravagantly, while the common people suffered from hunger and cold. Faced with such injustice, some chose to put up with the hardship while others rose in rebellion—Rufus belonged to the latter.\nAfter the fall of the old kingdom, Rufus became the leader of a mercenary group. Having suffered under oppression and driven by a strong sense of justice, he never treated the people with violence like some of his peers. It was this quality that attracted honorable warriors like Gina, who chose to join him and become his followers.\nRegrettably, Rufus' journey came to an abrupt end one day. After receiving a secret commission, he left with an expedition team and was never seen again.\n\nRufus was entrusted with escorting his client through a remote valley into the underground. As the mysterious client put it, the outcome of that trip would determine the fate of the entire world.\nDespite thorough preparations, the journey was more perilous than Rufus had anticipated. The mist shrouding the valley seemed to take a toll on the mind, causing the expeditioners to experience hallucinations, lose track of time, and suffer memory distortions. One by one, they fell behind and disappeared...\nBy the time Rufus finally arrived at the narrow fissure leading to the underworld, his client and he were the last ones standing.\n\nIt was a whole new world beneath the surface.\nAfter traversing a vast jungle of giant fungi, wading through winding rivers, and evading the pursuit of underground dwellers, they arrived at their destination—a seemingly ordinary relic. The client introduced it as a machine created by an ancient civilization, capable of awakening the entire planet.\nRufus thought his client had lost his mind, but after all the hardships they endured to reach the place, he still gave his all to help activate the relic. Once all the necessary steps were completed, the relic came to life, and something appeared to awaken. As Rufus gazed at \"the presence\" through the open stone gate, both he and his client were engulfed by a dazzling light...\n\nWithin the light, Rufus witnessed the birth, rise, and fall of civilizations in an endless cycle... as though he was having a dream. When he finally woke up, he couldn't tell how much time had passed. His client was nowhere to be seen, and the relic further deteriorated. The memories of his experience in the light began to fade, leaving him with nothing but unanswered mysteries as he walked away.\nWith the fissure to the surface gone, Rufus made his home in the underground settlement, earning the respect of its inhabitants through his bravery. Years passed before another expedition team found him and brought him back to the surface. Everything felt unfamiliar, but he took solace in seeing The Eagles thriving under Gina's leadership.",
