  "story": "Magnus is one of those rare heroes who can confidently claim to have defeated an ice dragon den with his bare hands, tamed the untamable Beast of the Abyss, and single-handedly beat back an entire legion with a pistol and three mud-filled socks. Read all about it and more in Magnus' hot-selling autobiographical series \"The Adventures of Magnus the Magnificent\", which are allegedly \"based on true events\". Indeed, Magnus is already more myth than man in the eyes of countless youngsters all over the Tundra.\n\nSadly, Magnus has yet to confirm or deny which happenings in his \"autobiographical\" series are actually true events. By contrast, famed explorer Bahiti has on several occasions publicly described Magnus' claims as \"99% bunk\" and the work of an \"average explorer who for all of his skills remains no more than that\".\n\nBahiti and Magnus' testy public relationship was not always so heated. On at least one occasion the present-day foes saved each other's lives.\n\nExplorers to the end, Bahiti and Magnus once found themselves holed up in the ruins of an ancient city. Argument over finder's rights quickly gave way to panic on seeing an approaching mercenary group. Surrounded on all sides by ancient buildings that were either crumbling or riddled with traps, they formed an uneasy but effective alliance. Even Bahiti admitted it probably saved their lives—proving Magnus must have at least some skill. Their only regret? What little treasure they retrieved had not been worth the taking.\n\nSadly, this brief friendship soon crumbled under Bahiti's renewed mockery of \"Magnus the Magnificent's tall tales\", who returned to defending himself against Bahiti's \"conspiracy of skepticism\".\n\nMagnus' obsession with becoming the best explorer of his age must be traced back to his parents' legacy. Although ordinary hunters in their time, the couple always claimed to be descendants of the world's mightiest pioneers, and were convinced the same heroic blood flowed through their son's veins. It was not long before Magnus began to adopt the look and characteristics of his imagined ancestors—with swashbuckling style and heroic exaggeration. Mockery from other children had no effect.\n\nOf course, Magnus is not just a speaker of words but a doer also, who by vigorous training almost backs up the boasts of his youth. Unfortunately, his exaggerations have expanded with age too. As summed up by Jesse: \"Whatever you might say about Magnus, there's no denying his many stories have brought joy to countless kids.\"\n\nMagnus' impressive list of ancestors include a famous adventurer who explored the seven seas, every continent, priceless archaeological ruins and ancient treasures beyond number. Not even the autobiographical version of Magnus has done that. The only achievement his ancestral pioneer left incomplete? Reaching the edge of the world.\n\nNot to be outdone, Magnus has publicly sworn to fulfill his ancestor's unfinished dream by planting his family crest on the very edge of our planet. This great feat, he has declared, shall be performed come what may—even if, as some have warned, the Earth is actually round.",
