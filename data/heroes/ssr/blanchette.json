  "story": "Blanchette seems like a sweet and innocent girl until you come face to face with her triple-barreled rifle muzzle or see the efficiency with which she picks off men and beasts at a distance.\nAs a marksman or tactician Blanchette is probably the second or third most dangerous enemy you could possibly face in the wilderness. She is a master of firearms and not afraid to strike first.\nThere is only one reason to think otherwise: Blanchette takes care of a large group of orphaned children taken in by her late father, the orphanage's founder. Only in their presence will her cold exterior give way to warmth and laughter.\n\nBlanchette did not feel she was much more than a child herself when she became the leader of the orphanage, and has always tried to provide a safe space for her younger \"brothers and sisters\" since—with toys, treats, or even funny costumes, decorations, and plays.\nOne moment Blanchette may find herself acting out the role of \"Red Riding Hood\" or the \"Big Bad Wolf\" on a makeshift stage. But the terror will be far more real for anyone who might threaten her orphanage than ever experienced by any of those characters. Indeed, with the passing of time, there are moments Blanchette finds it hard to separate herself from the roles she plays on stage and the warrior she has to be out on the Tundra.\n\nBlanchette's father founded the orphanage in a fort purchased after a long career as an explorer. It is from him Blanchette inherited not only clarity of judgement but also excellent combat instincts.\nHer father's dreams of creating a safe space for abandoned children was quickly dashed after his passing, when her father's successor filled his pockets with the orphanage's riches before fleeing into the night. All alone, the children turned to young Blanchette. She would have to grow up very quickly.\nTheir first big test came soon after. A dangerous group of bandits had heard a false rumor the castle was filled with riches and broke in with knives and guns. Blanchette escorted the children to a safe space and then began picking off the intruders one-by-one.\nIt was a kind of baptism of fire into adulthood. When Blanchette finally opened the door to where the children had been hiding, she was nearly covered head to foot in bandit blood.\n\nCrisis averted, finding money to buy food became the orphanage's main worry. The older kids had to start work immediately in the nearby city with Blanchette taking on more lucrative, but highly dangerous bounty hunter contracts.\nSo great were Blanchette's worries then she could hardly sleep at night, and yet always put on a brave face for the children. The orphanage did not find itself on stable ground until the Dawn Alliance arrived with funding in exchange for Blanchette's assistance. Now she had the confidence to step out onto the field as one of the Dawn Alliance's newest and most dangerous assets.",
