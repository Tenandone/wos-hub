  "story": "Meet Hector, star of the arena, undisputed champion of the brave new world of gladiatorial combat in the post-Great Chill era. Here is a man whose search for worthy opponents, and their defeat, contributes much to his sense of honor and self-worth. Hector's approach to battle tends to be the approach of a furious thunderstorm or suppressive tornado, being crushed. Nevertheless, one should not miscontur Hector as a brute. On the contrary, he is renowned on the arena circuit for his comprehensive understanding of mixed fighting styles and psychological warfare. Combattant like Hector have been given increasing opportunities in recent times with new arenas awarding fighters for competitive skills, particularly with the rise of many new succesful cities. these opportunities have been tremendously exciting for Hecotr, particularly the prospect of more challenging adversaries.\n\nHector was born to a small, impoverished town without the protection even of a single Furnace. Times were tough and, unfortunately, there wasn't enough food to go around. Although just a child, Hector was left to fend for himself in the wilderness. It was a grim lesson on the consequences of fragility. Hector's first test arrived in the form of a hungry wolf separated from its pack. True to form, they fought and Hector won! The remarkable triumph caught the attention of a passing Chief named Garald. So impressed was Garald at the boy's abilities, he took Hector under his wing.\n\nChief Garald was a loyal member of the Icebreaker Alliance, a league that placed great importance on martial prowess. So it came as no surprise when he initiated Hector's training in the gladiatorial arts with an eye to eventually sponsoring him in the arena. Combined with Hector's natural aptitude, he soon became the strongest of Garald's formidable warriors. Like Garald, Hector too embraced the importance of militarism and strength. By contrast with Garald's strong city, Hector's hometown had already succumbed to the ice and snow long ago. Hector's exceptional strength, skills, and talents earned him immense arena prestige. If Hector feared anything, it must be the memory of his vulnerable youth and its unsettling possibilities. Hector began to believe all hardships in life can be attributed to weakness-whether his own or that of others.\n\nHector believed that it was weakness that distorted the heart, vulnerability that drove humans to the unspeakable. And Hector also developed a deep disdain for those that did not share his ideology until disaster prompted a more nuanced understanding. Hector was visiting an arena when an immense snowstorm suddenly swept through. Having survived, Hector watched other survivors, most of whom he regarded as feeble incompetents, band together to rescue many others including Hector's own colleagues. Although each was weak individually, together the town had formed a mighty rescue force. The incident invited some soul-searching. Hector had begun to reassess what true strength really means.",
