  "story": "It would be harder to find a more mismatched duo than the nimble Edith and towering Mr. Tin in any city. And yet this odd pair have done far more for local residents than most, and earned whatever supplies they require many time over.\nEdith cannot remember a time when the metal humanoid affectionately named \"Mr. Tin\" wasn't a part of her life. His origins are a mystery -- as much a mystery as her own origins at least. But such mysteries pale in significance to the very real help by which Mr. Tin has made himself indispensable in every settlement and a favorite of children everywhere.\n\nMr. Tin did not always have a name nor a home, unless it were considered the enless Tundra. And so it would have a remained until his parts had rusted or the end of the world but for encountering a strange cradle heated by intriguing mechanic. A baby slept within.\nWhy did Mr. Tin shield the cradle in its arms until its deliverance to a nearby city? Instinct? Her cries certainly made impression on the terrified resident shrinking back from the metallic monstrosity. But actions speak louder than words. The cityfolk decided to welcome the duo with open arms. It is from this day forward that Mr Tiun earned this name.\n\nMr.Tin had won a permanent home amongst humans although nothing is free in an eternal winter. Mr Tin worked tirelessly to assist the growing Edith and ensure the city never lacked for manpower.\nEdith grew into a precocious scientist, endlessly fascinated by her local library and the inner workings of mechanical devices of all shapes and sizes, especially her humanoid benefactor. She was a quick study, and soon became relied upon by Mr. Tin exclusively for repairs in wich she was more skilled than any other city craftspeople.\nEdith graduated into the role of Mr. Tin's spokesperson, substituting body language and his simple vocalizations for a language by wich the pair seemed to easily communicate. It was easy enough as, instead of parting ways as the years wore on, Edith and Mr. Tin were increasingly drawn into shared endeavors and each other's company.\n\nMr. Tin's source of power was not exactly a secret although in these times only the most well-educated could guess at the mysterious Fire Crsytal that lay humming beneath his shiny exterior. Yet how the Fire Crystal had been installed and the colossus created remained unanswered. In fact, the entity had begun as a prized masterpiece of a power-hungry maniac intent on a source of authority not reliant upon human subjects. A humanoid form and Fire Crystal were chosen, the which also imbued it with a primitive form of thinking, reasoning, and even what one migth call a kind of living vitality. The mechanical beast was trained with ruthless efficiency against mock targets yet failed to translate its destructive skills against enemies of flesh and blood. Nor did any amount of threating or shouting by the angry maniac make any difference.\nThe maniac's pet project, despite its early success, had failed. Mr. Tin was discarded to the silvery wastes of snow with contempt and, until Edith, a solidarity existence except for the occacional bird or animal. It proved the existence of a deep.",
