  "story": "Lloyd comes from Ostermore, the \"City of Artisans,\" famed for its astounding mechanical craftsmanship. His family is well-known for their clockmaking expertise. The grand clock tower in town, where he currently resides, is his father's masterpiece.\nAs the only son of a master craftsman, Lloyd showed exceptional talent from a young age, effortlessly mastering skills including calibrating the clock tower and repairing intricate pocket watches. His father, often engrossed in his work, had little time to spend with him. Therefore, Lloyd crafted a few \"friends\" for himself—a cheerful bronze bird and a singing robotic frog. With their companionship, Lloyd enjoyed a joyful childhood.\n\nSometime later, the town welcomed two new residents—a giant robot named Mr. Tin and a red-haired girl named Edith. Lloyd found his new neighbors fascinating and quickly befriended them. As they grew up and learned together, he developed a close bond with Edith, and he couldn't resist the urge to explore Mr. Tin's internal structure.\n\nOstermore had always been a peaceful place, until the arrival of some outsiders who called themselves Phaethon.\n\nThey came in search of the last remaining part of a so-called \"War Machine,\" intending to use it as a prototype for building a formidable army of robots. To this end, they seized control of the town and captured Edith and Mr. Tin.\nWrenches and hammers couldn't compete with bullets, but the craftsmen weren't ready to throw in the towel. As darkness fell, a quiet rebellion began to take shape in unseen corners...\n\nWhile the Phaethon soldiers changed shifts, the townspeople, aided by machines, launched a counterattack. Lloyd's father led the charge, and Lloyd himself, now a brave young man, was among the fighters.\nThe cuckoos disrupted the enemy's vision, and propeller bombs wreaked havoc behind them. In the end, the craftsmen reclaimed their town just before dawn. Lloyd spared Mr. Tin from being dismantled in the nick of time and freed Edith.\nHis father's injury cast a shadow over the victory—his movement was restricted by a severe spinal injury. Yet, neither Lloyd nor his father allowed this to bring them down. With Lloyd's improving skills, they believed he would one day craft the perfect exoskeleton, allowing the legendary craftsman to stand once more.",
