  "story": "Commander of the Night's Guard, Viveca is a cold and stern leader who just so happens to also be a marksman with perfect accuracy. Her lifelong mission is to contain the disaster triggered by the Blood Moon plague, to confine it within the mist-shrouded domain of the Abandoned City—a place she once called home—and she will stop at nothing to achieve her mission.\nFacing the mutated beings that emerge from the mist, most would be petrified, as those enemies defy all understanding. Viveca, on the other hand, faces them without the slightest flinch, as she knows their weaknesses. Under her fearless leadership, members of the Night's Guard have also found the courage to face the darkness head-on.\n\nViveca is usually cold, quiet, and aloof. She keeps most people at arm's length, and her only companion besides Freya, Dr. Philly, and a few Night's Guard officers is her pet raven, Veilwing. Her personality seems innate, as if she were simply born without emotions, but Freya knows the truth: Viveca has experienced too much trauma to let her heart remain open and vulnerable.\n\nIf Viveca is usually cold, then on the battlefield, she's utterly frigid and ruthless. When the Blood Moon Plague broke out in the Abandoned City, she had to slaughter her very own friends because they'd mutated into inhuman horrors. Even today, she does not hesitate to pull the trigger when faced with allies who've been infected.\n\nThe survivors of the Abandoned City established a new settlement right outside the mist: New Metiya. A mysterious stranger later claimed the plague was not a curse, but an opportunity for transformation—an idea that has deeply unsettled Viveca after witnessing signs of intelligence within the infected.",
