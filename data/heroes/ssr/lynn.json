  "story": "Whether she is playing an instrument or reciting a poem, Lynn’s performances are always enthralling. As a bard, she visits from city to city to share the story of her bleak past to every corner of Icefield, hoping to lift the spirits of the people.\n\nBesides reciting poems and playing musical instruments, Lynn also excels in combat. Her instrument, \"Aira’s Tear,\" is modified from a weapon, so it can be used to play music and battle. During one of her performances, a group of bandits barged into the tavern, leaving everyone startled and confused. It was Lynn who fended off the bandits singlehandedly amid the music and gunfire. For that, some say that she should include her heroic deeds in the poems she recites.\n\nLynn’s best work is a song titled \"Aira’s Dream,\" but she rarely sings it. Those who are lucky enough to have heard the song claim that Lynn only sings it when she's drunk. As a result, plenty of \"seasoned drinkers\" have tried to make her perform the song by having a drinking contest with her. However, these overconfident challengers were long drunk before they achieved what they want.\n\nLynn was once a musician from a small town. After her town was invaded and occupied by the bandits, she lost her home and eventually became a mercenary. As the years passed, she became more skilled at wielding her weapon, but she had forgotten how to play her instrument. Memories of her hometown too faded away, with the scenery looking like a fantasy in her dreamland. Just like that, a former musician had evolved into a merciless mercenary captain. Her soul was never the same.\n\nIt was a day that ended Lynn’s career as a mercenary. Her team was ordered to besiege a town. Just as she was about to succeed, a song performed by an elderly musician came from within. The tune, which was buried deeply in Lynn’s memory, originated from her long-gone hometown—Aira. She thought no one would remember the song, just like how her hometown was forgotten.\n\nThe sentimental tune made the mercenaries pause in their tracks. Like their captain, tears were streaming down their faces. After everyone left, Lynn returned to the embrace of music and stayed with the elderly musician with a youthful spirit. It was only when the musician passed away did Lynn embark on her journey of becoming a bard.",
